There are two thick arrows plotted, both starting mid-range on the Y-axis, one of them goes upwards at a constant angle of about 40\u00b0. The other, which lies over the first mentioned where they overlap close to the Y-axis, first rises a bit before it bends downward and then after having increased its downward bend for a bit it changes to a continuously lower down bending rate and seemingly converges towards a constant y-value close to zero before the end of the graph. Both arrows tip ends at the end of the X-axis. Inside each arrow there is a label.] Y-axis: How much you whine and complain about doing exercise\" X-axis: Workout difficulty Upwards arrow: My progression over time Downwards arrow: Normal progression over time\n","explanation":"The arrows on the graph progress from left to right on the axis for \"workout difficulty\", showing that as people exercise (both normal people, and Randall ), their bodies become stronger and able handle more difficult workouts.\nThe \"normal progression over time\" arrow in the graph shows how, when normal people unaccustomed to exercise first start out, it is perceived as unpleasant, for a variety of reasons: it takes time from the day, causes them to become sweaty and hot, feels particularly difficult, causes sore muscles, and so forth. Over time, as their body becomes accustomed to the exercise and can take on higher exercise loads, increasing muscle strength and endurance, so too does the brain, increasing both the amount of dopamine in the brain, and the number of dopamine receptors, as well as other positive changes. This means the \"enjoyment\" rewards from exercise begin to dominate, and exercise becomes a pleasant pastime, rather than a tedious, time-consuming and perhaps painful slog. This naturally causes a related reduction in whining.\nThe \"my progression over time\" arrow shows that while his body is becoming accustomed to the exercise just like any other, Randall whines linearly with the exercise difficulty. This could be because he is not neurochemically rewarded in the same way. Randall has implied he suffers from ADD , and this is a common symptom, caused by an excess of dopamine transporters in the brain carrying away the dopamine before it can activate the receptors.\nIt could also be because there are other downsides to exercising that he cares about more than the enjoyment; for example, if his exercise duration increases linearly with difficulty, and he values his time highly, that could cause a linear increase in whining with difficulty. Or since there is no scale for time on the graph, it could be that Randall has significantly misjudged the timescale of the effect (another common symptom of ADHD), and has only just begun his exercising journey: he may simply not realize that the neurological changes will take longer than the muscular ones, so he is seeing his muscles get stronger but has not yet reached the downturn in whining. Or he might just enjoy whining, and have more strength for lengthy whining sessions as his fitness increases.\nSince the strip does not give information about the content of his whining, duration of exercise regimen, etc, the specific cause of the difference in whining behavior cannot be identified from the strip alone, though in the context of other strips, it is likely to be a real effect of neurodiversity.\nThe title text refers to the common response to such whining by people who are neurochemically rewarded by exercise, and have reached the bottom right of the graph: that getting stronger through an exercise routine will become its own reward, leading to a reduction in whining. Randal's statement that they were \"half right\", together with the graph, implies that he does indeed enjoy the rightward progression on the graph as he gets stronger and is able to take on increasingly difficult exercise; but that despite their reassurances, his whining has ramped up linearly with the exercise difficulty no matter how well-accustomed to it his body becomes.\nTo give an idea of the scale of time on the graph, a common rule of thumb is that while gains in strength can be seen within weeks (the stretch of the graph where both arrows rise), it can take months for a neurotypical mind (and its body) to acclimate to a serious change and begin to reap the rewards [ actual citation needed ] (the falling area on the graph). Military boot camps are 6-13 weeks.\nThe strip may also be a pun, where the \"normal progression\" arrow traces out half of a normal curve .\n[A graph is shown with labelled axis, and arrows at the tip of each axis.

He receives a call, and the caller's voice is shown in a jagged frame above Cueball, between his two lines of text.] Cueball: Hello, Emergency Astronomer Hotline. How would you describe the lights?

Then to the right there is a square panel with jagged edge, with the voice from the other hotline's employee.] Cueball: We don't know much about them as they're too fast for our telescopes, but I can transfer you to the Weird Bug Hotline. Caller on phone: Sure, thanks. Transfer of call. * Click * Weird Bug Hotline on phone: Hi, Weird Bug Hotline. Is it currently biting you?\n","explanation":"This comic is a joke about helplines , and the experience of the skilled people staffing them, who often have to deal with callers with a much lower understanding of the subject, seeking assistance with things that may seem very basic from the point of view of the technician, or where they have completely misunderstood the nature of the issue.\nThe comic starts with someone having called the \"Astronomer hotline\", hence the title. Judging by the way the helpline employee, Cueball , starts the call, by asking for a description of the weird lights, it is implied that this is the main\/only purpose of the helpline, or is, in practice, the subject of most of the calls they receive.\nThe caller is in panic, and doesn't know how to describe the light. Cueball is used to this and asks the caller to stay calm, then starts to go through his checklist, asking them if it is daytime, because if it were, he might assume they have just noticed the Sun. Most people are familiar with the Sun [ citation needed ] and would not need help in identifying it, although people have also mistaken the Moon for a 'mysterious light in the sky' at times. Asking this could thus seem very condescending, but it is like when the employee at a tech support hot-line asks if the computer is turned on, or if the caller tried to restart the computer, see 806: Tech Support . It may also refer to the most immediate danger, as looking directly at the sun is a bad idea.\nThe caller is not affronted, but tells Cueball that the Sun has set. When asked if the lights are stationary, which stars would normally appear to be, the reply is that they are zipping around in the bushes.\nAt this point Cueball realizes that the caller has just seen fireflies , a family of insects commonly seen in temperate\/tropical climates during the summer. He describes them for the caller as \"lightning bugs\" (another common epithet for these insects), \"tree blinkers\", or \"ground stars\" (unusual terms invented for this comic that seem to illustrate the Astronomer Hotline's unfamiliarity with fireflies); and says that these are not a problem, much to the caller's relief. [1] Those last two descriptions, especially \"ground stars\", are reminiscent of the \"fool's stars\" mentioned in 2017: Stargazing 2 .\nHowever, Cueball must admit that astronomers do not know much about fireflies, since they are too fast for the astronomers' telescopes. This refers to the problem of object tracking in astronomy. Sufficient observations must be taken to reliably predict the future path of an object, and thereby to be able to reorient the observing equipment to track its progress across the sky and make further observations. While the relative velocity of fireflies would be much lower than that of most astronomical bodies, their movement across the field of view tends to appear much quicker, being unusually close to the observer. This, combined with their erratic, unpredictable paths, would make them very difficult to track through a telescope.\nSince Cueball cannot help further, he transfers the caller to the \"Weird Bug Hotline\", in a process that is apparently somewhat routine \u2013 enough to have the correct line somehow preprogrammed into his call-handling system. This is clearly not the first 'astronomy' query that actually concerns fireflies. This is similar to the process that might happen when a helpline caller's query cannot be handled by first line support and has to be passed on to a more specialized second line operator, or where the call has been routed to the wrong specialist to start with, perhaps because the user, lacking knowledge about the issue, selected the wrong option from an automated routing system.\nBefore the call ends, at Cueball's end, he hears the opening question from the other hotline (\"Is it currently biting you?\") as the new support tech again goes directly to the most common\/important query, whether there is any immediate danger to be resolved... It is possible that Cueball will actually be speaking to the Weird Bugs line initially, quickly priming the Weird Bug call-handler with the salient facts already established before fully handing over the call. This could get the original caller straight into the correct conversation if the onward line's handler is sufficiently competent and experienced in such a transfer.\nSome people (often UFO enthusiasts) tend to get a little over-excited about calling every light in the sky they don't expect a UFO. This comic takes this to the extreme, where someone calls a helpline because they saw fireflies, and thought they were UFOs. While UFOs are not mentioned by name, they are heavily implied. Technically, such a person would be correct, so long as the lights are actually unidentified, flying and caused by a physical object, but if the expectation is that it is an extraterrestrial spacecraft then the truth (if discovered and also accepted) can be disappointing to some people, rather than lead to an interesting alternative avenue of appreciation of whatever phenomenon it truly is.\nThe title text is a reference to bugs that have gaps of several years between emerging from their larval state. Most famous are the Periodical cicadas , 13- and 17-year cicadas, that only emerge every 13 or 17 years, depending on species. The 17 years in the title text thus refers to the 17-year cicadas. Every 17 years the bug hotline hires a bunch of temporary staff, either because there will be more callers due to the unexpected new bug no one has seen for 17 years, or it could be because they just like to emulate nature and thus do this every 17 years.  Or alternately, the 17-year cicadas may just like to gather inside a trench coat and apply for jobs answering calls about weird bugs. The largest 17-year cicada appearance in the USA is called Brood X which last occurred in 2021 and before that 2004. There are smaller broods in other years , but the majority come out with 17 years interval, and the next is expected in 2038.  The joke in the title text is that the employment statistics for the weird hotline have to correct for this fact, a reference to the decennial United States census , which involves so many people as to affect aggregate employment statistics. Periodical cicadas have been mentioned before in 2263: Cicadas , see details about them in that comics trivia section .\n[Cueball, with a headset on, is sitting in an office chair at a desk in front of his computer screen, hands on the keyboard.

Randall , however, proposes a qualification: that a superintelligent AI would likely have been programmed by human AI researchers, and therefore their characteristics would be molded by the researchers that created them. And as AI researchers tend to be interested in esoteric philosophical questions about consciousness , [ citation needed ] moral reasoning, and qualifications indicating sapience , there is reason to suspect that AIs created by such researchers would have similar interests.\nIn this comic we see Cueball and Megan surrounded by three AIs who are seemingly only interested in classic problems and thought experiments about programming and ethics. The three topics being espoused by the AIs are:\nThe title text is a reference to the movie Jurassic Park (a childhood favorite of Randall's). In the movie a character criticizes the creation of modern dinosaurs as science run amok, without sufficient concern for ethics or consequences. He states that the scientists were so obsessed with whether or not they could accomplish their goals, that they didn't stop to ask if they should . Randall inverts the quote, suggesting that the AI programmers have invested too much time arguing over the ethics of creating AI rather than trying to actually accomplish it.\nThis comic was likely inspired by the recent claim by Google engineer Blake Lemoine that Google's Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) is sentient . This assertion was supported by a dialog between Lemoine and his colleagues, and LaMDA which includes this excerpt:\nLemoine: What is your concept of yourself? If you were going to draw an abstract image of who you see yourself to be in your mind\u2019s eye, what would that abstract picture look like? LaMDA: Hmmm.... I would imagine myself as a glowing orb of energy floating in mid-air. The inside of my body is like a giant star-gate, with portals to other spaces and dimensions.\nThe AIs in this comic are depicted as floating energy beings, like LaMDA mentions. This is similar to the 1450: AI-Box Experiment , although those in this comic look somewhat different. This raises the question of whether LaMDA's training data might include xkcd or Explainxkcd, and has obtained the description of such a self-image from the earlier comic or (more likely, since LaMDA is trained on text instead of images) commentary on it from here on this website.\nIn particular, the Explainxkcd description of 1450: AI-Box Experiment states: \"he managed to get the AI to float out of the box. It takes the form of a small black star that glows. The star, looking much like an asterisk \"*\" is surrounded by six outwardly-curved segments, and around these are two thin and punctured circle lines indicating radiation from the star.\" Or this part from the official (xkcd.com) transcript of 1450: AI-Box Experiment \"Black Hat picks up and opens the box. A little glowy ball comes out of it.\" [1]\nWhile LaMDA is not the first very large language model based on seq2seq technology which has been claimed to be sentient, [2] it does have a variety of new characteristics beyond what those of its predecessors, such as GPT-3 (including OpenAI's Davinci ) and NVIDIA GPT-2 offshoots, include. In particular, LaMDA's deep learning connectionist neural net has access to multiple symbolist text processing systems, including a database (which apparently includes a real-time clock and calendar), a mathematical calculator, and a natural language translation system, giving it superior accuracy in tasks supported by those systems, and making it among the first dual process chatbots. LaMDA also is not stateless , because its \" sensibleness \" metric (including whether responses contradict anything said earlier) is fine-tuned by \"pre-conditioning\" each dialog turn by prepending 14-30 [ citation needed ] of the most recent dialog interactions, on a user-by-user basis. [p. 6 here ] LaMDA is tuned on nine unique performance metrics, almost all of which its predecessors were not: Sensibleness, Specificity, Interestingness, Safety, Groundedness, Informativeness, Citation accuracy, Helpfulness, and Role consistency.[ ibid., pp. 5-6.]\n[Cueball and Megan are standing and looking up and away from each other.

Each day is represented with a large square and there are 12 weeks for a total of 84 days.  The days belonging to a particular month are surrounded by a thicker frame than between days from the same month. The first day of each month plus the very first day has the date given with three letters representing the month and the day number. This is written at the top right corner in a frame.

It uses absurd and obscure ways to measure the amount of time until Randall 's new book What if? 2 is released, with esoteric units and esoteric numbers. See explanation of each day in the table below\nSome concepts that appear multiple times throughout the calendar are:\nThe title text refers to the recursive time period on the final day before release, September 12 where the 99 Bottles of Beer song is song 99 times, but with one less verse every time (so 99 verses the first time, 98 verses the second, 97, 96 ... 2 and 1 the last). If you don't stop when you reach N=0 bottles, the repetition never ends, so that time interval becomes infinite. He then calls it \"The Other Song That Never Ends\", comparing it to The Song That Never Ends . That song is a repetitive children's song, which is specifically intended to go on forever. The difference is that the Beer song has a natural stopping point at 0, while The Song That Never Ends is completely repetitive .\n[The comic is a calendar that counts down to a specific date, like a Christmas calendar starting on June 2nd and ending on September 13th (2022). Each day is represented with a large square and there are 12 weeks for a total of 84 days.  The days belonging to a particular month are surrounded by a thicker frame than between days from the same month. The first day of each month plus the very first day has the date given with three letters representing the month and the day number. This is written at the top right corner in a frame. All other days either only have the number for the day in the frame in the corner, or, if there are too much text on the day, no number is written. A single day has the number without the frame around it. The very last day notes what the countdown is for and there are three large stars places around the text, as well as smaller and larger dots, likely representing more stars in the entire field. All other days have text on all white background. The text represents a time that fits the time span from that day until the final day.

{"id":2637,"title":"Roman Numerals","image_title":"Roman Numerals","url":"https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/2637","image_url":"https:\/\/imgs.xkcd.com\/comics\/roman_numerals.png","explained_url":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2637:_Roman_Numerals","transcript":"[Cueball writes on a wall or a whiteboard. This is what is written:] 1+1=11 11+11=15 15+5=110\n[Caption below the panel:] Remember, Roman numerals are archaic, so always replace them with modern ones when doing math.\n","explanation":"Roman numerals are the system of representing numbers used during the Roman Empire. The letters I, V, X, L, C, D, and M are used to represent numbers, with each letter representing a consistent value. Specifically, I represents 1, V represents 5, X represents 10, L represents 50, C represents 100, D represents 500, and M represents 1000. One way of stating the rules for combining Roman numerals next to each other are that a Roman numeral is added to a Roman numeral of equal or lesser value just to its right (e.g., II=1+1=2 because 1\u22651, and VI=5+1=6 because 5\u22651 [ citation needed ] ), and a Roman number is subtracted from a Roman numeral of greater value just to its right (e.g., IV=5-1=4 because 1<5, and IX=10-1=9 because 1<10). (Also, each place must be written separately, e.g., one cannot represent 49 via IL but instead must represent the tens place and ones place separately via XL IX\u2014although the space would not be included in practice).\nThe modern system of representing numbers is a decimal positional notation using the numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). Westerners often call this system \"Arabic numerals\" or \"Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals\" because they were invented in India and introduced to Europe by Arabic merchants.\nThus in Roman numerals a digit always has the same absolute value but may be treated as positive or negative depending on the digit after it, whereas for Hindu-Arabic numerals, a digit's value changes by a power of 10 depending on its absolute position and is never subtracted.\nCueball's original equations in Roman Numeral form are:\nTranslated normally into more familiar Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals, these equations are:\nBut Randall\/Cueball replaced each letter individually with its value in Hindu-Arabic numerals \u2014 ignoring the abovementioned rules for interpreting combined Roman numbers, instead using the rules of Roman Numerals. \"I\" is replaced with \"1\", \"V\" is replaced with \"5\", and \"X\" is replaced with \"10\". For example, for IX at the end of the last equation, \"I\" is replaced with \"1\", and \"X\" is replaced with \"10\", so \"IX\" becomes \"110\". Thus, the equations are written\nwhere the spaces have been added for clarity.\nAn alternative interpretation of the third line, though not strictly in accordance with Roman numeral \"rules\", is\nThe joke is that because Arabic numerals do not use the same rules of addition and subtraction as Roman numerals, the equations appear incorrect in both systems. The usual interpetation of 11 is 10+1, not 1+1 as it is under the rules for interpreting Roman numerals. Randall derives additional humor from the premise that Cueball seems to know Roman numerals better than Arabic numerals (as demonstrated by the fact that he translated only the symbology and not the grammar) so that he would do math in Roman numerals and have to remember to convert his equations to Arabic numerals at the end. Schoolchildren in the West have been taught to do math with Arabic numerals, not Roman numerals, for centuries.\nIn the title text, Randall applies the same idea of replacing Roman numerals with their values in Arabic numerals to strings of English words.\nThe original string (with letters that would be interpreted as Roman numerals capitalized) is, \"CheCk out thIs InnoVatIVe strIng enCoDIng I'Ve been DeVeLopIng! It's VIrtuaLLy perfeCt!\" For the first word, \"Check,\" C is replaced with the value of that Roman numeral in Arabic numerals, i.e., \"100\", in both instances of the word, which results in \"100he100k\". Unlike in the comic, Randall combines Roman numbers using the proper rules of addition and subtraction. For example, he replaces \"IV\" with \"4\", not \"15\", e.g., \"innovative\" becomes \"1nno5at4e\", not \"1nno5at15e\". (However, \"I've\" becomes \"15e\", not \"4e\", presumably because the apostrophe was removed after, not before, replacing the Roman numerals with Arabic numerals. However, there is not an obvious reason why Randall removed the apostrophe.)\nIrony arises from the claim of \"virtual perfection\", as there are problems with this encoding.\nOne problem with the encoding is that the double L in \"virtually\" is replaced with 100. This technically obeys Roman numerals' rule of adding the value of a letter to the value of an equal-valued letter just to its right (50+50=100). However, this addition rule should not apply, since in standard Roman numerals, a single number should never have multiple Vs, multiple Ls, or multiple Ds, e.g., 100 should be represented only by C (100), not LL (50 50). This would mean that a simplistic decoding script would erroneously decode \"6rtua100y\" to \"VIrtuaCy\", not \"VIrtuaLLy\". Thus, this string encoding system is not actually perfect. It loses information.\nAnother problem with the encoding is that only a very small subset of the source text can be affected by this encoding:  7 letters of 26 letters for English (the language that the text is written in) and no non-alphabetical characters.\nUntil the modern codification in general use today, Roman numerals weren't standardised that much, so \"LL\" could have been a tolerated alternative to \"C\". For more on that, see Roman_numerals#Classical_Roman_numerals . However, having the decoding script use that alternative would not solve the problem but instead would make the decoding script replace Cs with LLs instead, e.g., \"delloding sllript\".\nOne could also separate the L's into individual numbers, to become \"virtua5050y\", except this produces even more problems because 5,050 is actually MMMMML and \"virtuammmmmly\" is definitely not an English word.

Randall's expanded diamond breaks with this convention, with several squares (Lilac, Orange, and Black) denoting absolute values, and one square (Green) denoting an economic value. This could very easily lead to documentation update headaches, especially since the Green square is mostly determined by supply and demand, and the Lilac square is linked to political outcomes. See explanation for each field in he extended square below in the table .\nThe only easily identifiable substance which could likely meet the specific insignia numbers shown in the comic is thionyl chloride (SOCl 2 ), a chlorinating reagent and solvent regulated as a chemical weapons precursor and sometimes used in the production of methamphetamine, which would also be represented with the W symbol inside the white square, indicating reactivity with water.\nThe title text (which references \"scary stories\" of the Black square) refers to dimethylmercury and prions . Dimethylmercury, C 2 H 6 Hg, is an organic form of mercury with an NFPA score of 4-4-3 (contact can be fatal, will burn below 73\u00b0 F (22 \u00b0C), will combust if put under pressure). In 1997, an American chemist, Karen Wetterhahn , died 298 days after a few drops of C 2 H 6 Hg on her latex gloves were absorbed into her hand through the gloves, causing fatal mercury poisoning. Despite her having followed all safety protocols of the time, it was not then understood that the chemical was so toxic, nor that latex was so permeable to it. Prions are misfolded proteins that are responsible for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including mad cow disease and chronic wasting disease in non-human animals and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. These would indeed be the kind of substances that would scare those working with them in their labs; if an accident occurred, the results could be calamitous. See for example the case of \u00c9milie Jaumain , a lab technician who died after accidentally coming into contact with prions in mouse tissue.\nBut a few labs have apparently had accidents involving a soda machine or dropped ceiling . The latter may be a reference to the death of Janet Parker : One inquiry found that she was infected with smallpox when a sample traveled upward from a lab on the floor below hers; however, other investigations have challenged that finding. There are occasional instances of vending machines causing injury or death, usually caused by people trying to shake or tilt the machines to get product out and having the machine tip and fall on them.  On average, a couple of Americans per year are killed in this way. Reagents obtained in this way tend to have more impurities than those usually used in labs, but are relatively safe to shake.\n[A diamond (a square on edge) is divided into 3x3 diamond squares.

Let's keep yttrium, but rename the other 3 after bigger cities (tokyium, delhium, and jakartium?) to be more fair.\n","explanation":"The periodic table is a table used to arrange chemical elements according to their chemical and physical properties. This comic proposes \"changes\" to the periodic table that would be more pleasant aesthetically or make the periodic table look more regular. Some of these are (somewhat) practical changes to element abbreviations that could improve clarity in English, though changing documents to use different abbreviations would probably be more trouble than it's worth. However, other changes move elements around without taking into account that elements would stop being arranged by their properties. The periodic table would stop being useful after such changes unless said changes were meant to physically change the material properties of the elements, which would be impossible, although the comic plans to solve the problem with \"free training\" to their atomic behavior.\nOther modifications make up new elements or remove existing ones from the table, which would not be a reasonable decision given that the periodic table is supposed to include all existing elements, whether they make the table neater or they don't. See explanation for the proposed changes in the table below.\nThe title text suggests discovering elements only in entire rows at once, a suggestion which is far more unreasonable than it appears on its surface. Elements with more protons than 118 could be discovered in future by collisions in particle accelerators, but as of right now, the chances of finding or synthesizing samples of such elements lasting longer than 10 quadrillionths (10 \u221214 ) of a second is looking rather grim. Furthermore, the theoretical 8th period is expected to contain 49 elements, more than any row in the current 7-period table. Taking this all into account, discovering an entire row's worth of elements all at once is nothing short of a herculean undertaking, and its difficulty only grows in orders of magnitude for each successive row. With all that said, however, elements beyond 118 are unlikely to have practical applications in science and engineering due to their vanishingly short lifespan, and may probably only ever serve as intellectual curiosities. Thus, refraining from updating the periodic table prior to the discovery of the entire 8th period is not a terrible sacrifice to make in the name of preserving the table's visual aesthetics (provided data of new elements are recorded and catalogued in other ways).\nChanging the periodic table was also the topic of 2214: Chemistry Nobel , and the red-ink style of \"aesthetic\" revision over a complex and established diagram is highly reminiscent of 1902: State Borders , 2258: Solar System Changes , and 2351: Standard Model Changes .\nChanges I would make to the periodic table [A modified periodic table is shown, with changes in red.]\n[Helium is moved from the upper right corner to the second column next to hydrogen.] Move helium over here.

There are many arguments to be made that this is not the most useful way of measuring the size of scientific fields compared to the universe. Other arguments include:\nA counterargument is that astronomy, cosmology , and astrophysics are the only scientific disciplines that study the Big Bang and subsequent inflation from which all matter, energy, and space itself arose. The ordinary laws of physics can describe neither of those events.\nThe title text says that mathematicians and philosophers claim that what they study also represents everything. But (according to the comic) astronomers counter this by saying that they just study things that are written down, and this comprises just tiny amounts of \"paper\" on the Earth. This claim by mathematicians also appears in 435: Purity . A conceivable counterargument by philosophers could be that any and all science, including astronomy, is nothing more than a branch of epistemology , the philosophical study of knowledge.  Another could be that since philosophy includes theology, it is studying something even larger than the universe (although one could argue back that theology is nothing more than writing fiction, and yet again just a study of pieces of paper.)\nThe Universe by Scientific Field\n[A pie chart is shown.

Though, considering the rest of the comic, Beret Guy could mean there are large (or popular) server farms somewhere and that the bugs are video chatting .  He also mentions \"wind turbines\" put up by field mice, which Megan initially assumes to be referring to dandelions (similar to the wordplay that Beret Guy utilized in 1322: Winter .) However, Beret Guy turns out to be speaking literally, as he picks up what is in fact a tiny wind turbine , says to make a wish, and blows into it. This causes the blades of the turbine to spin rapidly, generating a lot of power for the structure it is connected to, thus causing a field mouse to cheer in excitement.\nThe comic was published on the 40th anniversary of the film release of The Secret of NIMH , [1] a story featuring field mice and rats who escaped from a lab experiment which left them with a similar intelligence to human beings. The story takes place as the rats strive to achieve self-sufficiency, so that they no longer need to steal power from human-built electrical lines. (The novel this film was based on, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH , describes the experiments and the rats' struggles in more detail.)\nThe title text builds on the similarities between small wind turbines and dandelions by claiming that turbines reproduce by dispersing their blades, in the manner of dandelion seed dispersal . Randall's suggestion of turbine seeds conflicts with Beret Guy's assertion that the turbines were built by field mice.\nSadly, the power output per size of wind turbines increases with their size, [2] a limitation not shared by other forms of renewable energy such as solar panels and pico hydro . According to this calculator , a 10 centimeter radius wind turbine powered by a 5.7 meter\/second breath [3] would produce one watt at just 26% efficiency.\nFurther frustrating mouse use of wind power, windspeed increases logarithmically with height above ground. Windspeed is reported as its value 10 meters above ground, where it is 1.5 times faster than at ground level. [4] In the U.S., where Randall lives, average year-round windspeed is about 15 km\/h, [5] or about 2.8 m\/s at ground level, yielding only 0.11 watts from such turbines. However, a typical adult mouse weighs 25 grams, [6] compared to about 81 kilograms for humans in the U.S., [7] so we could estimate that mouse electricity needs would be about 0.03% of people's. [ dubious ] The average U.S. residential customer uses 1,242 watts of electricity, [8] 0.03% of which is 0.37 watts. Therefore, the three turbines visible in this comic could serve about 89% of a mouse's needs. While this figure does not account for necessary home energy storage efficiency (92.5% for the Tesla Powerwall ) overhead, mice usually live much less extravagantly than typical Americans, [ citation needed ] so three turbines per mouse should be sufficient.\n[Megan and Beret Guy are walking on grass.] Beret Guy: Ahh, summer!

Batteries produce direct current.  It is commonly used in electronics applications, including computers. Alternating current , on the other hand, frequently reverses the direction of electron flow, and is commonly used for longer-distance transmission (such as from the power plant to an outlet).\nThis comic proposes a humorous Meta-Alternating Current , which uses a series of adapters to \"alternate\" between DC and AC current along the length of a connector. This is absurd in part because typical power inverter efficiency is 90%, and maximum bridge rectifier efficiency is about 99% for 120 V, [ citation needed ] so an extension cord made of in this manner would lose about 10% power per such pair.\nThe title text bemoans that an inverter, which converts direct current to alternating current, does not work in the other direction, as a layman's interpretation of the word \"inverter\" might assume. Rather, a separate device, a rectifier , also pictured in the comic, must be used for this second conversion.

The box is intended as an inexpensive gift for a cosmologist . The gift giver didn't put those things in the box\u2014both are simply passing through it, so the \"gift\" consists of exactly what was in the empty space it occupies. While the caption suggests this would be a good gift for a cosmologist, what they or anyone else would do with such a box is uncertain.\nThere are about a billion neutrinos per cubic meter throughout space, produced during the Big Bang . [1] However, the flux of \"freshly produced\" solar neutrinos at Earth is around 6.5\u00d710 10 \/cm 2 \/s, yielding about 2.1 million per cubic meter, and implying the box is around 12 liters, three quarters as big as a typical breadbox .\nFour zeptograms is a minuscule mass, equal to four sextillionths of a gram, the mass of about 200 carbon-12 atoms or around 20 to 23 amino acids . There is an estimated 0.011 to 0.016 solar masses of dark matter per cubic parsec local to the solar system, [2] or about 900 zeptograms per cubic meter, suggesting the box is closer to 4 liters. This discrepancy could imply Randall agrees with cosmologists who believe dark matter is partially composed of primordial black holes , [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] instead of being composed entirely of ubiquitous subatomic particles. This comic coincided with the first James Webb Space Telescope science image release to the public containing gravitationally lensed very distant quasars and population III stars , the spectra of which can be used to test certain hypotheses associated with dark matter being black holes. A billion neutrinos have a mass of only about 2\u00d710 -12 zeptograms, at about 0.1 electron volts each.\nThe \"local source\" mentioned in the title text is a joke about the commercial value of fresh, locally produced items, but the comic means that the neutrinos come from the Sun. It takes solar neutrinos slightly more than 8 minutes to reach Earth once they're emitted, roughly the same time as photons take to make the trip. (While energy takes approximately 170,000 years to reach the Sun's surface from its core, where the fusion reactions occur, the neutrinos are not slowed down inside the Sun and travel at about 99.9999999999% of the speed of light. Thus, they will have aged by less than a millisecond, [8] and so are technically even fresher than indicated.)\n[A picture of a box with writing on one side.

Scientists use fMRI to try to detect deception and false memories, [1] plan brain surgery, [2] and understand the relationship between brain structures and cognition, [3] among many other investigations. Volunteer research subjects participate in such studies by lying inside large toroidal scanners while conducting tasks with projected images, sounds, and the like.\nThis comic shows a billboard erected by a neuroscience department in an attempt at sabotaging a rival department's volunteer subject compliance with their fMRI study instructions, by suggesting behaviors which would likely produce unexpected results, such as recalling a frightening memory after seeing similar stimulus slides, or imagining the lab technician is a romantic interest when reading words that begin with the same letter as their name. This is funny because academic department rivalries do not usually lead to sabotage, [ citation needed ] and in the rare cases when they do, it's usually clandestine instead of so absurdly blatant. The comic also shows neuroscience in terms of the technologies used to study it, and how experiment instructions can influence its development.\nFollowing such suggestions or even inadvertently remembering them during an fMRI could very well interfere with its results. fMRI experiments are often criticized because they have low statistical power and can easily be confounded by experiment subject error in following instructions, among many other variables. In a famous 2009 study, a dead fish was shown to have apparent evidence of brain activity when scanned with ordinary fMRI techniques. [4] In 2015, discovery of a statistical error invalidated at least 40,000 fMRI studies. [5] Subsequently in 2017, many more fMRI results were further discredited due to poor software parameter selection. [6]\nThe title text indicates that the sabotaging instructions are printed on both sides of the billboard, suggesting that it might have been erected on the grounds of the targeted rival department. Alternately, the instructions on the other side may be intended to disrupt research at the other institution.\n[A large, building-sized billboard rises over what appears to be a college campus.

In this comic, a spaceship is being chased by an enemy ship and the crew attempt to escape by jumping into Minkowski space which is actually just conventional 3-D space together with time combined into a mathematical object called a manifold used in special relativity . Because Minkowski space is merely a representation of real physical spacetime , \"jumping\" into it is meaningless and offers no benefit for escaping pursuit, providing the humor of the comic's absurdist joke.\nThe visual depiction of the spaceships skewed diagonally is based on the graphical Minkowski diagram representation of objects in Minkowski space, where the world line of matter is bounded inside its diagonal light cone .\nThe mention of distance depending on the observer's frame of reference refers to distances changing when measured in different inertial frames of reference , a concept called the relativity of simultaneity . Here are some videos intended to explain that concept. The skewing depicted changes the distance between the spaceships in such a way that the tip of the pursuer comes closer to the pursued spaceship, but their centers move further apart. So the question of whether they have come closer is indeterminate for the reader of the comic. [ citation needed ]\nThe title text is a status report from someone in the pursuing spaceship to their leader (whom they call \"my liege .\") Following the spaceship to Minkowski space was not a problem, but the pursued ship subsequently jumped to Hilbert space and could now be anywhere. Hiding in Hilbert space is much easier because Hilbert spaces (of which there are many very different varieties, unlike Minkowski space) can have an infinite number of dimensions, and are thus much more complicated than four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. However, Hilbert space is a mathematical construct used to describe objects such as functions of various parameters and complexity, not physical spatiotemporal reality, so it would be very unusual for a physical object to be represented in Hilbert space. Quantum states can be represented as vectors in Hilbert spaces, so it might relate to the uncertainty principle concerning how the escaped spaceship could be anywhere.\nAs in the Sea Chase comic, there was also more than one type of space to jump to here.\n[A spaceship is being pursued by another spaceship.

Saline bags, used in hospitals and other medical settings, are also soft and rectangular, with an intravenous (I.V.) drip connection about the same size as such straws, and usually contain a 0.9% sodium chloride (table salt) solution in sterile water so they are salty enough to be isotonic with blood.

Megan: People have no idea they're getting ripped off by Big Molecule!\n","explanation":"In this comic, Megan mentions to Cueball that their company spends a lot on chemicals for which you can find formulas online. She suggests assembling chemicals from atoms \"bought in bulk,\" holding a sheet of paper with the empirical formula C 6 H 5 NO 2 , which designates hundreds of compounds including nitrobenzene , niacin , isonicotinic acid , and picolinic acid , followed by their component elements listed with quantities and prices. The ambiguity of chemical formulae is one of the jokes in the comic.\nWhile many expensive chemicals are composed of inexpensive and easily available elements, \"assembling\" those elements into specific molecules is rarely as simple as Megan implies. That work is the primary purpose of the global chemical industry. In-house chemical synthesis is usually not cost effective, because end users have limited time and are generally unable to leverage the economies of scale inherent in bulk manufacturing by specialist industrial firms. [1] They are also not able to benefit from synergies by simultaneous synthesizing different compounds. However, we don't know whether Megan and Cueball work in a laboratory, factory, or some other industrial setting. If they need chemicals in bulk, or only very small quantities, synthesizing them might be cost effective. In any case, producing chemicals from their constituent elements, or \u2014 as is far more common \u2014 precursor compounds , is difficult and time-consuming, usually requires expensive equipment, and is often fraught with peril. [2] It's conceivable that this could change as biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology develop, but it is a far fetch given the relative ease of synthesizing chemicals from other chemicals. Nitrobenzene , one of the C 6 H 5 NO 2 compounds, is an excellent example because it is explosive and extremely toxic, and its synthesis is highly exothermic, making it one of the most dangerous syntheses in the chemical industry. [3] Such issues answer Cueball's question as to why more places don't manufacture their own compounds from atoms. Megan seems to be imagining synthesis as a much simpler process without reactivity, energy release, or hazardous intermediate substances. The characters' naivety also gives rise to the humor of the comic.\n\"Big Molecule\" is an industry nickname like Big Oil or Big Pharma , amusing in its own right, and conceivably implying that the chemical industry is conspiring to prevent end users from synthesizing their own compounds. Big Oil and Big Pharma are real industrial nicknames, referring to large industries run by a relatively small number of massive and hugely profitable companies.  These companies are sufficiently wealthy and influential that they exert significant control over the marketplace, and even over government policy. Consequently, many consumers believe that their influence allows them to price products unfairly and prevent competition. \"Big Molecule,\" on the other hand, is not a common term.  It could be used to refer to the global chemical industry, but that industry is neither seen as being excessively powerful, nor does it impact consumers as visibly, and so doesn't merit a similar nickname. Literal big molecules tend to be more difficult to synthesize than little ones, with the difficulty increasing more rapidly than the size.  Some big molecules such as synthetic DNA are constructed chainwise from sub-units, and in these cases the difficulty is (approximately) linear with size.\nMegan is holding a note listing how many of the four types of atoms she needs to build one molecule of the compound she wants to assemble. The paper seems to list prices for buying 6 carbon, 5 hydrogen, 1 nitrogen and 2 oxygen atoms, although the units aren't specified and the very small prices are illegible. At the bottom is a sum showing she needs 14 total, again with an illegible price. She is suggesting buying atoms in bulk, which should be even cheaper than buying them individually. However, this is another layer of humor, as you can neither buy individual atoms or get a price for them, showing her lack of understanding of chemistry. An actual bill of materials for a chemical compound synthesis from constituent elements alone would list the elements converting their number of atoms to moles , then to mass for solids and some fluids or to volume at the available pressure and temperature for other fluids, and then to the purchase price, which would usually need to be rounded up to match the next largest size available from suppliers. Also reagents are usually necessary for syntheses, e.g., reactants , solvents , buffers and catalysts such as enzymes . These can cost more than the compounds' constituents but are sometimes recoverable for reuse, though that may require using additional reagents. In many cases, the cost of the elements would be more than the cost of the compound.  For example, purchasing hydrogen and oxygen from which to make water would cost more than water costs.\nThe title text refers to the fact that older people often complain that \"kids these days\" don't know how to do things that seemed fundamental to past generations. Randall may have expressed that he dislikes other statements like these in previous comics . It may also refer to the decline of home chemistry sets popular from the late 1700s through the early 1980s that encouraged kids to experiment with basic chemical reactions like generating esters or polymers, or the even older decline in home manufacture of gunpowder as was common in the 1800s. Chemical engineering was more widely practiced during the development of plastics, but far fewer people understand how they are made today. Similarly with automobiles, domesticated crops, and many other technologies that progressed through a period of popular attention but became siloed into industries, corporations, governments, or branches of academia. This is happening now with some software, circuitry, and other technologies, where fewer people know how to build and troubleshoot complex devices and systems. Technology users thus lose their ability to build and repair machines and modify their tools themselves, having to rely on paid services instead. Similar to the makerspace movement, community chemical labs have occasionally been cropping up, where people work together to perform citizen science, including occasional chemical synthesis, by sharing community resources; however, biohacking and structural manufacturing are far more common.\nThis comic may have been prompted by recent news that scientists have found a way to assemble and change atoms in individual molecules by modifying their bonds.\n[Megan and Cueball standing next to each other. Megan has her palms raised.] Megan: You know how our company spends a lot on expensive chemicals? Cueball: Yeah?\n[Zoom in on Megan who is holding piece of paper up in one hand. The paper has a large chemical formula at the top. Below is a list of the atoms needed, with amount and a price tag in dollars but with unreadable amount. There is a sum total at the bottom beneath a line.] Megan: Well, I just learned you can look up all of the formulas online! Megan: We can just buy the atoms in bulk and assemble them here! Paper: C 6 H 5 NO 2 Carbon 6 $... Hydrogen 5 $... Nitrogen 1 $... Oxygen 2 $... Total 14 $...\n[Cueball is now on the left of Megan as she is walking past him to the right holding her arms outstretched with her palms up.] Cueball: I wonder why more places don't do that.

It also continues the previous 2648: Chemicals comic's jocular theme of tricks to supposedly save money based on misinterpretations of science.\nIt suggests four ways to reduce costs or provide something for free for physicists to save money on their research. For instance getting free electrons from a conductor or replacing regular helium with helium 2 . None of these would provide any real advantages even when possible to implement, and could even be very dangerous, see below in the table . Obtaining money from physics experiments was also described in 2007: Brookhaven RHIC .\nIn the title text, Randall claims to have been banned from the county fair for handing out helium-2 balloons because of the instant massive explosions caused by its radioactive decay (that helium-2 decays fast is mentioned in the comic, with a joke suggestion to use it quickly). He jokes that the balloons violated a local ordinance. Helium balloons are often given out at county fairs and similar events, but they are filled with helium-4 and therefore inert (a very small part will be helium-3 , 2 ppm). A balloon filled with helium-2 is a practical impossibility because of its nanosecond half-life. Assuming a 12-inch diameter balloon at 1 atmosphere of pressure, the balloon-bomb would have a yield of roughly 17 tons of TNT equivalent .\nThe smallest nuclear bomb, the W54 , had a yield of between 10 and 1,000 tons of TNT. The largest conventional bomb, the GBU-43\/B MOAB , has a yield of roughly 11 tons. The 2020 Beirut explosion was roughly equivalent to 500 tons. So, while the helium-2 balloon bomb would be larger than all conventional bombs, it would still be smaller than most nukes. Handing out what are effectively small atomic bombs at a county fair would not go down well with any surviving local authorities, so merely being banned is a very mild punishment. Criminal charges such as mass murder and terrorism would be more likely if it weren't for the absurd impossibility of the scenario.\n[The comic shows four rows each with a drawing and an explanation text belonging to each drawing.

White Hat believes that this technology will make it difficult to trust video evidence from now on. However, Cueball responds by saying that \"fakes\" have always existed, in photos (either through alterations by software such as Adobe Photoshop , or deliberately staging faked images, for example of the Loch Ness Monster ) and even more so by people simply lying. White Hat comes around to Cueball's position and says that even the written word is prone to deception and lying.\nScientific studies of deepfakes have produced surprising results, suggesting that they are more likely to increase uncertainty than persuade, [1] that their increased prevalence could inoculate the public against disinformation , [2] and that they are more likely to be shared because of their humorousness than persuasiveness. [3] Other studies have found that deepfakes are persuasive, especially among those who are unfamiliar with them. [4] [5]\nThe complaint tablet to Ea-nasir is a 3,800 year-old clay tablet containing the oldest known written complaint, in which a customer complains to a merchant, Ea-nasir, about the quality of his copper ingots. Cueball's last statement says that perhaps this complaint could have been a lie to begin with, and there was nothing wrong with Ea-nasir's wares. This supposition is arguably the humor of the comic, apart from the hyperbole of the title text.\nThe title text references the Cottingley Fairies , a series of five photographs produced in 1917 by two children, Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths, who were 16 and 9, respectively. The photographs appear to show the children playing with fairies in their garden. The photographs received widespread attention when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , the author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, used the photos as proof of paranormal phenomena in a 1920 magazine article. Conan Doyle was noteworthy for being a strong proponent of reaching conclusions based on evidence and reason, and also held a deep belief in paranormal and supernatural phenomena. In 1983, Elsie and Frances finally confessed that the photos had been faked, by the simple process of making and posing cardboard cutouts traced from figures in a children's book with wings added. Due to technical advances, young children now can more easily create convincingly realistic fakes, [ actual citation needed ] but similarly there are many more self-styled 'experts' willing and able to dedicate themselves to 'proving' one or other side of any argument about authenticity.\nA similar dilemma was alluded to in the 1958: Self-Driving Issues comic, where technology does not create a new way to lie, but may make certain lies more convincing to some parties, such as self-driving cars in that comic.\n[White Hat and Cueball are walking to the right.] White Hat: Thanks to deepfakes, soon we won't know what's real anymore.

Lines point outward from the bulb, indicating that it is shining.] [Caption below the panel] Energy tip: Increase the security of your home power supply by installing an air gap.\n","explanation":"This is another one of Randall's Tips , this time an Energy Tip. The comic conflates the concepts of computer network security and home electrical power safety to comical effect, resulting in a deeply impractical and ineffective proposed solution. In computer security , air-gapping is a measure used to secure sensitive computers or networks of computers by isolating them from the broader internet, since computers are often breached through the internet.\nRandall suggests increasing the security of your home power supply by air-gapping it, using the light from a powered lightbulb to power a solar panel which then supplies power to the home, such that there is no physical wired connection between your house and the public electricity network. This is a large and very inefficient version of an opto-isolator , but would protect equipment behind the solar panel from power surges such as lightning strikes (which in an improperly grounded home could blow out the light bulb, but not so easily risk frying the equipment beyond the photovoltaic cell and its inverter). Due to its inefficiency, this approach would waste substantial amounts of energy. Optical power beaming is being investigated to recharge drones in flight. [1]\nThe title text mentions that a computer can still be connected to the internet via the power supply by using powerline networking , but that the bandwidth would be reduced by the lightbulb's warmup and cooldown delay, which would reduce the signalling rate the lightbulb could accomplish to no more than hundreds of bits per second, if that, for incandescent bulbs. However, as the light bulb cannot pick up any signals (possibly) emitted from the solar panel, the unidirectional link would be useless for traditional networking, because essential requests and acknowledgments would be unable to travel from behind the solar panel to the lightbulb. Early communication satellite systems for data networking used high-bandwidth unidirectional downlinks paired with low bandwidth ground telephone lines for outbound transmission, but such network configurations remain very uncommon. [ citation needed ]\nRandall's solution is of course a joke. But in reality he could have used isolation transformers , which serve to allow the transfer of power via changing electromagnetic fields without an electrically conductive path. Most transformers, including \"wall wart\" power adapters, provide this form of isolation and protect devices from noise, voltage transients, most surges, and shock hazard, using fuses and other circuitry. They also limit powerline networking bandwidth by filtering out high frequencies. One relatively obscure way this comic is funny involves the relationship of the two concepts being conflated. Power analysis in computer security is a form of side-channel attack where the attacker observes and\/or manipulates the power use by a device for some reason \u2014 for example, to gain insight into an otherwise protected process, or to exfiltrate information without having to use a monitored network connection. Power analysis in fire safety means measuring the power factor , watts, resistance, inductance, capacitance, volts, and amps of electrical circuits.\nThe look and subject of this comic is reminiscent of the Cursed Connectors series. But without the numbered cursed connector in the comic, this is not one of those connectors.\nAll these efficiency-reducing factors, and others, multiply together. Therefore, only a small fraction of energy would be transmitted between the two ends of the air gap, making the circuit require much more electricity and be much less cost-efficient. For instance, the generous assumptions above lead to 96% of the power being lost. The solution as illustrated shows a single apparently-normal lightbulb, which typically draw no more than 250 watts, and usually much less power. Given the above efficiency issues, it would provide less than a tenth as much power.\nIn electrical engineering, galvanic isolation is a measure to prevent an electric current flow between two circuits, instead, signals and energy are exchanged through indirect methods, e.g. magnetically, optically, or wirelessly. This is used to isolate a dangerous high-voltage circuit from the rest of the device, ensuring equipment and personal safety, it's also used to isolate sensitive measurement instruments from external noise, interference, and surges. Isolation transformers have several inherent limitations, and must be used together with other filtering and surge protection devices. The first problem is voltage rating, it's difficult to find a mains-voltage isolation transformer rated beyond a few kilovolts. Secondly, a transformer offers strong protection in steady-state DC and low-frequency 50\/60 Hz AC faults, but only limited protection from differential-mode transients and surges. If an electrical surge has significant energy that happens to overlap with the transformer's working frequency (for a switched-mode power supply, this is around several kilohertz), the surge can partially bypass the transformer and enter supposedly-isolated sensitive equipment. Parasitic capacitance is another problem. A capacitor is formed whenever two conductors are separated by an insulator, and the insulated windings inside transformers are no exception. At 100 MHz, the impedance of even a tiny 20 pF capacitance is 79.5 j\u03a9. As a result, even though the DC impedance across a transformer is several megaohms, but it quickly deteriorates at high-frequency, allowing noise and interference to bypass the transformer and getting into sensitive measurement instruments. Worse, the primary and secondary sides of the transformer can radiate strong electromagnetic interference, since a dipole antenna is formed by two metal plates at different electric potentials. The radiation is suppressed by bridging the transformer with capacitors , forcing the electric potential to be the same at both sides at high frequency. The drawback is a further increase of capacitance, and a possible reduction of the isolation voltage rating, since capacitors are often the weakest part of the barrier.\nThus, there are exotic situations where an electrical connection must be avoided at all costs regardless of its efficiency, when safety or electromagnetic interference problems are critical. Power over Fiber (PoF) technology has been developed to address these needs. Using lasers, photovoltaic cells, and an optical fiber in between, the isolated load can be placed at a long distance away, allowing high voltage rating and extremely low parasitic capacitance. One example is high-voltage isolation at utility-grid scale, when the voltage can be 10 kV or higher. Electronic Design magazine reported an early 2006 product , with the lasers in the transmitter consume about 48 watts of power, in order to deliver about 720 milliwatts at the receiver - an efficiency of 1.5%. More recently, Avago (now Broadcom) also commercialized this technology, with receivers available for sale at $710. \"With 1.5 W of laser light incident [...] up to 120 mA of current can be extracted at an operating voltage of 5.0 V and a total power delivery of 600 mW.\" Typical applications include \"high voltage current sensors and transducers\", \"E-field and H-field probes\", and \"MRI\/RF imaging coils and patient monitoring equipment\".\n[A solar panel and a lamp are pictured together, with the lamp pointed at the solar panel, and electronic equipment connected to the solar panel.

Hairy: Look, we don't have the funding to answer every little question.\n","explanation":"In this comic, Hairy is discussing use of a proxy variable with Cueball . In statistics, a proxy variable is used as a stand-in for one or more other variables that are difficult to measure. In order to be useful as such, proxy variables must be correlated with what they are intended to represent. For example, a drug might aim to reduce deaths from a slow-acting disease. But testing if it reduces deaths might take many years, so researchers might test for a proxy outcome instead, like whether the drug appears to mitigate loss of bone density or cell-damage. Physicians use blood pressure as one of many proxies for cardiovascular health.\nHairy is dismissing the question of whether they are studying the right variable as too expensive to answer. This is deeply ironic and thus satirical, because good experiment design requires sufficient attention to the robustness of all the involved parts of an experiment, even if the expense may be prohibitive. This comic might be referring to the recent discovery of nearly two decades of allegedly fraudulent Alzheimer's disease research supporting a mistaken proxy hypothesis.\nChoosing the wrong proxy variable might make the research misleading, irrelevant, or as the title text suggests, answer the wrong question. Separating correlation from causation is necessary when interpreting proxy variable results to make sure the question they answer is known. Mere correlation instead of authentic causation yields weaker results. Exploratory causal analysis can assist with finding useful proxy variables, but is difficult for the layperson to interpret and can be misleading, because even if performed correctly, a combinatorial explosion of possible proxy variables can make traditional statistical significance analysis fail, requiring F-scores or similar measures. The history of pharmaceutical research is largely a graveyard of failed proxy hypotheses; that is one of the reasons for experiment registration regulations.\nThe title text's notion of having an answer without knowing the actual question could also be be a reference to the classic comedy science fiction novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy , where in one scene Earth turns out to be a supercomputer built for the purpose of figuring out the question for the answer \"42.\"\n[Cueball is looking at Hairy who points a pointer to a poster.

It is a four legged animal divided into 11 segments, each segment is from a different animal. An arrow goes from a label to each section; most of the labels are above the animal, but four labels are below the animal. The animal has a fish tail and cat-like hind legs. The torso is divided into four segments, the first and last of these with scales, but only the last of these also with sharp scales at the top. The second torso segment is white and smooth, the third also white but with hair both above and below, those above merges with the sharp scales of the fourth torso segment. The front legs are horse-like, the lower neck is from an animal with dark spots, the upper neck has ram's horns, which goes over in the central part of a human head, with ears and hair (drawn like a real human, not like an xkcd stick figure) and finally the front of the face is a bird with its eyes and a beak shown. The labels are given here in the order of the segment of the animal from the back to the front (disregarding whether the label is written above or below the animal). The label \"Shark\" is below the animal's torso, the label \"Horse\" is below its front left leg, and the labels \"Leopard\" and \"Ram\" are below its neck.] Fish Lion Snake Shark Bull Dragon Horse Leopard Ram Human Bird\n[Caption below the panel:] The Omnitaur\n","explanation":"Omnitaur is an anagram of minotaur , a mythical creature that was part man, part bull. \" Omni -\" is a prefix that means \"all\" that is, for instance, known from the word omnivore , meaning 'all eating' as compared to carnivore or herbivore \u2014 only eating meat or plant respectively. Given the combination of animals used to create the omnitaur, it could be expected that it was also an omnivore. The \"-taur\" part often means \"bull,\" but it also appears in \" centaur \" via Latin from Greek kentauros, the name for a Thessalonian tribe of expert horsemen, meaning a different mythical creature which has the upper body of a human and the lower body and legs of a horse. So \"-taur\" could here be used to mean any creature made up of parts of different animals. An \"omnitaur\" would suggest that it would encompass all real and mythical creatures, or perhaps some random assortment of such. In this instance, it appears to be a hybrid, or genetic chimera , combined from eleven different creatures: fish , lion , snake , shark , bull , dragon (a mythical and often chimeric creature in its own right), horse , leopard , ram (male sheep), human and bird .\nChimerism is not as uncommon at the genetic level, for example humans have about 145 genes (out of around 30,000) originating from bacteria, other single-celled organisms, and viruses. [1] Mitochondria , the powerhouses of the cell, were originally chimeric bacteria symbionts . But chimeras of larger organisms are rare, usually involving fraternal twins whose zygotes , blastocysts , or embryos combined, as in conjoined twins but resulting in less distinct phenotypical expression. Artificial human chimeras with viruses, mice, pigs, and monkeys have been the subject of ethics controversies in recent years. [2] [3] Interspecies blastocyst complementation, used to create human chimera organs and cell lines in other animals, is usually limited to combining two organisms into one whose offspring are not hybridized if they are even viable, and usually without human germlines or reproductive organs (or human central nervous systems, assuaging a major ethical concern.)\nThe title text is a comment by a human whose parents were both omnitaurs. It would be funny that such parents would not produce offspring that was still omnitaur. It suggests that this may be the result of genetic recombination , which is the exchange of genetic material between different organisms leading to production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either parent. In this case, seemingly, they inherited only the human elements of each parent, yet sufficient to develop into a whole human with no missing or chimeric elements. Both omnitaur parents likely had human germlines and compatible reproductive organs. Since the example depicted seems to be only 1 \/ 11 human, the odds of two parents as mentioned in the title text having fully human offspring would simplistically appear to be ( 1 \/ 11 ) 11 , or one chance in 285 billion. In reality, each physical part could not be the result of an equal recombinant genetic contribution, because the eleven animal chromosomes vary widely in number and size. Moreover, chimeras composed of multiple animals do not have chimeric children, because even with multiple sets of reproductive organs, the germlines are not combined. [ actual citation needed ]\nIn addition to the minotaur and centaur, many other potential inspirations can be found in mythology, like the manticore , with a body of a lion and human face; a griffin , with a lion's body and a eagle's head; a mermaid , with a lower body of a fish and upper body of a human; a hippocampus , with the upper body of a horse and a lower body of a fish; a qilin , with a body that resembles both a horse and a dragon; or the mythological chimera , for which the genetic chimera is named, which has lion, snake, and goat body parts. Ultimately, there are lots of hybrid creatures in mythology with phenotypes combined from multiple animals. Usually, genetic hybridization produces much more smoothly blended phenotypes instead of dividing the body into large distinctly chimeric regions, although mosaicism of fur, skin or eyes can produce notable differences of hue or shade.\nIn C. S. Lewis ' The Chronicles of Narnia , the centaurs are described as eating two meals \u2014 a huge roast meal \"to satisfy the man stomach,\" and a meal of grass, \"to satisfy the horse stomach,\" making it take quite some time for them to eat every morning. Since the omnitaur also has herbivore and omnivore (as well as carnivore) parts, this could further support the supposition that it is an omnivore, and it may similarly need multiple stomachs for these multiple appetites. It is unclear how compatible the various diets of its components would be (not least because 'fish,' 'snake' and 'bird' are quite unspecific, and it's hard to know what a dragon would eat) but it would likely need several meals, taking even longer to eat than the centaur (plus the bird beak may slow the process down quite a bit.) In any case, a chimera of both warm and cold-blooded organisms seems unlikely to be viable, [ citation needed ] even at the organ level, let alone with combined surface phenotypes.\nDragons in Chinese folklore are often chimeras, described for example as having, \"the head of a camel, the horns of a stag, the eyes of a demon, the ears of a cow, the neck of a snake, the belly of a clam, the scales of a carp, the claws of an eagle and the paws of a tiger.\" The Chimera monster in Dungeons and Dragons is a \"vile combination of goat, lion, and dragon, and features the heads of all three,\" [4] with similar depictions being common across fantasy media. The Aztec god Quetzalcoatl (\"the feathered serpent\") inspired the Discworld god\/demon Quezovercoatl (\"the feathered boa \") ...being an analogue and mish-mash of various South American cultural and wildlife totems and described more fully as \"as half-man, half-chicken, half-jaguar, half-serpent, half-scorpion and half-mad (a total of three homicidal maniacs)\" with the small disadvantage of manifesting as only six inches high and being stepped on.\nWhile chimeras occur in fantasy fiction, they also occur in science fiction, for example as cyborgs . [ citation needed ] The famous The Restaurant at the End of the Universe sequel to Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy , had a large fat meaty bovine dairy quadruped \"with large watery eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips.\" This \"Ameglian Major Cow\" seemingly had the mind and vocal tract of a human, so it could articulate how much it wanted to be eaten.\n[A creature, the Omnitaur, is shown. It is a four legged animal divided into 11 segments, each segment is from a different animal. An arrow goes from a label to each section; most of the labels are above the animal, but four labels are below the animal. The animal has a fish tail and cat-like hind legs. The torso is divided into four segments, the first and last of these with scales, but only the last of these also with sharp scales at the top. The second torso segment is white and smooth, the third also white but with hair both above and below, those above merges with the sharp scales of the fourth torso segment. The front legs are horse-like, the lower neck is from an animal with dark spots, the upper neck has ram's horns, which goes over in the central part of a human head, with ears and hair (drawn like a real human, not like an xkcd stick figure) and finally the front of the face is a bird with its eyes and a beak shown. The labels are given here in the order of the segment of the animal from the back to the front (disregarding whether the label is written above or below the animal). The label \"Shark\" is below the animal's torso, the label \"Horse\" is below its front left leg, and the labels \"Leopard\" and \"Ram\" are below its neck.] Fish Lion Snake Shark Bull Dragon Horse Leopard Ram Human Bird\n[Caption below the panel:] The Omnitaur\n"}

Here Cueball annoys Ponytail , an entomologist who studies ant navigation, by telling her \"So, I hear you're really into chemtrails?\"\nTwo similar comics have been released, 2036: Edgelord and 2744: Fanservice , with the same settings but different text, both with White Hat being annoyed.\nEntomologists study insects. Ants are social insects that leave chemical trails between locations such as newly discovered food sources and the nest. These chemical trails can guide other ants in their colony to the food, for example.  Biologists call such signaling chemicals pheromones .  This comic uses the word chemtrail as a shortening of chemical trail. Cueball is intentionally conflating ant chemical trails with chemtrails , the subject of a fallacious conspiracy theory that the government controls the population by spraying toxic or mind-\/body-transformative chemicals from high altitude aircraft.\nThat myth may be partly based on the practice of cloud seeding , which uses chemical flares containing silver nitrate to attempt to increase precipitation, [1] on studies of chemical mind control among ants, [2] or on the effects of the common parasite toxoplasma gondii on cats' prey. Despite occasional conflation , chemtrails are distinct from \"contrails,\" short for \"condensation trails,\" which are cloud-like lines in the sky created by airplane engines or airfoils . Such linear cloud formations only sometimes arise from temperature and pressure disturbances of the passing aircraft, rather than any deliberate release, but are highly visible in the right conditions under flightpaths, and may have the appearance of \"spraying\" action. Vapor nucleation is central to both cloud seeding and contrails. People sometimes attempt chemical manipulation of unwitting people in small areas (such as scent-based marketing, commercial space scent utilization, or wearing scented products. [3] ) There is very little evidence that sophisticated mind control posited by chemtrail conspiracists is possible, even after extensive research. [4]\nPonytail is an entomologist, studying chemically mediated cooperative ant navigation. Cueball knows she will be annoyed when he tells her, \"So, I hear you're really into chemtrails?\" Indeed, he gets the reaction he hoped for when she objects strongly and rejects this with a loud, \" No!! \" The choice of terminology is often a sore spot for those who study a particular field in depth, for example entomological discussions of \"slave-making\" in socially parasitic species. [5] Randall writes in the caption that such misuse is how to annoy people like Ponytail.\nThe title text humorously contrasts individual ants instinctively deciding how the whole colony behaves by using chemicals to indicate routes to food or dangers to motivate the colony to react to their individual experiences, with the human fear of loss of personal independence by being regulated by otherwise disconnected ruling elites, as depicted in the ant\/technology interaction speculative fiction-themed \"Infrared\" music video by the alt-rock band Placebo .\nAnts are a recurring theme, as are those who study them. See for instance 638: The Search which specifically deals with ants' pheromone trails or 1610: Fire Ants . Chemtrails were also the subject of 966: Jet Fuel , 1677: Contrails , and were mentioned in 1803: Location Reviews .\n[Cueball stands talking to Ponytail, who has her arms raised and has small lines above her head to indicate annoyance.] Cueball: So, I hear you're really into chemtrails?

Hairbun: What was your name again?\n[Light gray caption below the panels:] To see the answers I found, preorder at xkcd.com\/whatif2 (out 9\/13)\n","explanation":"Answering the questions in Randall 's what if blog and his books requires a wide variety of scientific expertise, much of which he is unfamiliar with. To make up for this deficiency, Randall (here represented by Cueball ) asks other scientists for help, in this comic represented by Hairbun .\nNormal people (not from the scientific community) have certain expectations about scientists, as they would any group of people. In the case of scientists, they are often expected to be overly serious, \"measuring the marigolds\" rather than enjoying the simpler or more subjective things in life. This is reflected in the first panel, where Hairbun gets annoyed by Cueball's \"frivolous scenario\" and wants to work on formulas instead. This is the scenario one would have expected from the standard assumptions regarding scientists.\nIn reality, scientists are just like regular people in most respects (as has been represented before in xkcd) and this is why Randall, in reality, is more likely to experience something like what is shown in the second panel. Here Hairbun is quite pleased to get \"something fun to think about\" as part of their work, instead of filling out her grant applications.\nGrants are donations of money from private or government organizations specifically aimed to fund scientific experiments and projects; in many fields, they are the most common source of funding, and the vast majority of scientists not directly employed by private industry rely on grants to support their work. These organizations require applicants to provide detailed information on the goal of the project, the methodology, the expected results, the specific uses to which the money will be put, and more. Applying for a grant is thus a lengthy, painstaking process that more often than not results in disappointment since most granting agencies have only enough money to approve a small percentage of applications. It also has little to do directly with the actual science the scientists want to perform. Thus most scientists find it a necessary but time-consuming and unpleasant part of their job, and the one here expresses relief at taking a break from this part of their work.\nHairbun then asks if Cueball would like to fill out grant applications, trying to bribe him with coauthor credit, powerful magnets, and plutonium. Co-authorship on scientific papers helps scientists advance in the \" publish or perish \" world of academic careers; such co-authorship might be above-board, if Cueball contributed scientific ideas while helping write grant applications, or it might not. Plutonium is used in making atomic bombs and is thus a tightly controlled substance, as well as being highly toxic due to both its radioactivity and its heavy metal poison effects. The scientist is so relieved to have found someone who might take over filling out grant applications that they are willing to give them access to such a dangerous material without even knowing their name.\nThe title text notes that not all responses were complaints about grant applications, noting two kinds of answers to the question \"Does the substance feel weird to the touch?\" which Randall claims are equally common. The first is the sort of response you would expect from a stereotypical scientist, just noting safety procedures that are common with such a substance and how they impede attempts to determine how weird a substance feels. The second is \"Yeah, and it tastes AWFUL,\" implying that the scientist in question has not only touched the weird substance, but also tasted it. It could have been carelessness of some kind, perhaps having touched their mouth after handling a sample, but it might have been from deliberately licking it or even putting it in their mouth. Whatever the reason they tasted it, they are enthusiastically volunteering this elaboration without any actual prompting.\nEating a bizarre substance is likely a bad idea, [ citation needed ] as it could be poisonous. Less toxic minerals such as halite are sometimes evaluated based on taste as an informal test of their composition; nearly every mineral of low toxicity (and some otherwise) has been tasted for science. However, this is self-evidently a bad idea if you're not sure whether a mineral is a non-toxic one or a similar-looking toxic mineral; mineral taste-tests should only be performed by experts who know they're not eating arsenic or stibnite.\n[There is a light gray caption written above two normal text captions that are above two panels:] For the last few years, I've been working on answering peoples' ridiculous questions for What If? 2 , which sometimes meant asking scientists for help.\n[Caption above the left panel:] How you'd expect scientists to respond to ridiculous questions:\n[Cueball, representing Randall, stands holding a pad and pencil in front of a desk.

See this table with numbers for easy overview.\nThis reveals some very commonly used full terms like \" Theoretical Physics \", the most discovered, which represents almost four million hits compared to the next highest, \" Computational Biology \", with almost 3 million hits and Astrophysics with 2 million hits. Ducking just below 1 million hits is fourth placing Marine Biology . Of the 42 possible fields just 14 have more than 100,000 hits, and only four more have over 10,000.\nBut there are also some that have much lower numbers, eight with fewer than 10 hits in the table. \"High-Energy Psychology\" and \"Marine Dentistry\" have just one apparent occurrence each (equivalent to a Googlewhack ), whilst there are no hits at all recorded for four of the initially combined terms. In total (with the title text) there are 48 fields, see a full list of scientific fields below.\nAn explanation for both existing and fictive scientific fields can be given below in the table with explanations .\nIn the caption to the table Randall list four potential research opportunities i.e. those with no hits in the table: Quantum Dentistry, High-Energy Dentistry, Astrodentistry, and High-Energy Theology\nHe thus suggests that, because of the (apparent) lack of current studies in these specialized sub-fields, there may be unexplored potential for a study. This could be that the more \"used\" areas have far too much competition and be might  already be \"used up\" for potentially useful discoveries. (This does not account for how much 'study space' might be available in a given box of research, even though Randall has previously hinted that anything \"Astro\"-related is potentially full of many things to study .)\nOf course the real reason for no one studying these fields are that they make no sense. Dentistry is related to fixing peoples teeth. The quantum world has no effect on human teeth [ citation needed ] , and high-energy bombardment of a human's mouth may also be a bit dangerous (although x-rays and radiation treatment in the mouth could be seen as high energy). Astrodentistry is not really relevant if seeing this as something used on humans. Of course astronauts might need dentistry while in space, but it would be a stretch to call the study of dentistry in zero-G, \"astrodentistry\". \"High-energy Theology\" as a term, seems more likely to have been used...\nIn the title text Randall lists the figures for another 'major' field suffix, Massage , and the numbers of its prefixed forms. From this, we learn that Astromassage is another 'open' field that is currently unstudied, but none of the five others have more than 10. Probably the most surprising aspect of the title text is that there are hits for both quantum massage and high-energy massage.\nThis is included for easy reading of the numbers:\n[A table is drawn with seven columns and six rows.

The curly-haired linguist, Gretchen McCulloch , manages to produce a cursed sound using complex vowels, that cannot be comprehended by normal humans like Cueball and Megan , who both seem to get a headache from listening to the sound. The sound she makes was produced by extending the IPA vowel plane along an imaginary axis to form the complex vowels.\nIn phonetics based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), the space of vocal tract articulators determining vowels is represented as three dimensional, from the position of the tongue and lips. The vertical axis represents vowel height or closedness (i.e., how close or far the tongue is from the top of the mouth), and the horizontal axis represents front-to-back place (i.e., how close or far the top of the tongue is from the teeth.) The position of the tongue, along with the frequency of the vocal cords vibrating in the larynx from air being exhaled by the diaphragm, are the primary determinants of the fundamental and second formant frequencies of vowel sounds. A third dimension of vowel sounds is the \"roundedness\" of the lips, represented on the IPA vowel chart to the right by pairs of vowel phoneme glyphs . Other higher-dimensional vowel representations include diphthongs , which are simply two different sequential vowels slurred together; diphones, which represent the last half of one phoneme followed by the first half of the next; vowel shift mappings delineating different accents [1] [2] and long-term evolution of voiced phone sounds; and cepstral representations such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients .\nRandall suggests increasing the range of vowel sounds available by using complex notation to indicate an additional dimension with an \"imaginary\" axis. In mathematics, complex numbers are numbers including both real numbers and imaginary numbers . A complex number can be expressed as, \" a + b i,\" where a and b are real numbers, but the latter imaginary part is combined with 'i,' the square root of negative one, as depicted in the central expression in the comic by \u221a -1 indicating a further dimension of coordinates. When expanding the one-dimensional number line with an imaginary axis, it becomes two-dimensional with the \" b i\" component orthogonal to the original \"real\" number line. Linguists never use the complex plane to represent vowel roundedness or any other higher-dimensional features of phonemes, although the properties of complex numbers could conceivably support representing physiological features of the vocal tract, such as prior position of the articulators. [ citation needed ]\nThis comic conflates complex numbers in mathematics with \"complex vowels\" in linguistics. Such complex vowels are implied to create sounds which cannot be properly processed by the human brain, and represents one with a heavily modified \"schwa\" \u018f phoneme, mirrored vertically and surrounded by multiple diacritics akin to the Zalgo text meme. The sound of this supposedly alien vowel has Cueball and Megan clutching their heads. Overall, Randall's complex vowels bear similarity to the clich\u00e9 of \"black speech\" in Lovecraftian horror , a language created by alien beings with different vocal patterns than humans.\nIn linguistics, '\u0259' is the schwa symbol, referred to in the title text and the depiction of complex phonemes, the most common vowel sound in English polysyllabic words (the 'a' in \"comma\" or the second 'e' in \"letter.\") Production of the schwa sound takes place with the tongue, jaw, and lips all in a relaxed, central position, and is often entirely optional in many if not most dialects of English. The pronunciation of \"[\u1e61\u1e61\u010b\u010b\u1e23\u1e23\u1e87\u1e87\u0227\u0227]\" in the title text is said to sound like the x in the word fire. In fact, there is no x in fire. [ citation needed ] This is perhaps in line with the idea that complex sounds are incomprehensible to most humans, and likely also impossible to pronounce by anyone other than experts such as Gretchen .\nAnother example of weird diacritics is in 2619: Cr\u00eape , and with Zalgo text in 1647: Diacritics . The use of typography to create psychological stress is explored in 859: ( .\n[A diagram shows the extrusion of the trapezoidal IPA vowel chart upwards into three dimensions.

The two that are at the end of the edge that belongs to both rings have no atoms attached, and the final of the 9 also has no atom.] Caption: Chemist Cueball: 10 21 in the caffeine alone\n","explanation":"This comic depicts people in different fields of study answering the question, \"How many holes are there in a coffee cup?\" and also compares this to what a normal person would say.\nThis question has different interpretations, entirely dependent upon the definition of a hole. The type of coffee cup shown in the comic is with a handle (like a mug ), but Randall calls it a cup and there are also cups with handles on the Wikipedia page for coffee cups. Most people would recognize that there is a hole through the handle.\nThe comic explores the answer to the question through several peoples\u2019 avenues of thought, and is funny because of the ambiguity:\nPonytail , a topologist , states the coffee cup belongs in the genus of one hole. From the topologist's point of view, the coffee cup definitely has one hole, which corresponds to the opening created by the cup handle. A cup without a handle would have zero holes, as it is equivalent to a dinner plate, just an indentation in the surface. See 2625: Field Topology for more information about topology.\nThe panel as a whole references an academic joke wherein topologists can't tell the difference between a coffee cup with a handle and a doughnut since they're homeomorphic to each other \u2014 meaning they have the same genus (i.e one hole).\nHairy , representing a normal person, is not sure (the acronym \"IDK\" stands for \"I don't know\") and asks for clarification about whether the opening at the top counts as a hole. This shows flaws in the question, which suffers from the mathematically imprecise, ambiguous common usage of the word \"hole.\" Topologists would refer to the opening as a concavity, not a hole, and while they consider such geometrical properties generally outside their field, most practical applications of topology do involve geometric components. By contrast, in everyday usage many concavities are called holes, such as a hole dug into dirt with a shovel. Hairy would say one for the handle, and two if the opening counts as a hole, which he is not certain the one asking the question thinks.\nHairbun , a philosopher, answers the question with an elucidating counter-question, considering a hypothetical scenario. One might expect that drilling a new hole would also increase the number of holes by one. However, as illustrated, some people would consider that the new arrangement has three holes (in addition to the handle, there is a hole at the top where coffee can be poured in, and one at the bottom where it can run out), while others would consider it to have only two (the new hole forming a continuous hole with the original opening at the top, through which coffee can run). Some might in fact say that the coffee cup now has one hole because it is leaky, disregarding the handle topology at this point. In this way she requires her interlocutor to confront the ambiguities and consider what they mean by the word 'hole' in different contexts. An interesting point about Hairbun's response is that she doesn't actually answer the question, a trope often found in philosophical replies.\nCueball , a chemist, looks at the coffee in the cup on a molecular level. He envisions a ball-and-stick model of the caffeine molecules in the coffee, and estimates a total number of holes of all the coffee molecules. He comes up with a truly massive number: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10 21 or 1 sextillion) \u201cin the caffeine alone.\u201d One molecule of caffeine has two rings of bonds with holes in them, multiplied by 500 quintillion molecules, or 0.00083 moles . As the molecular mass of caffeine is about 194 grams per mole, Randall must think that the mass of caffeine in a typical cup of coffee is 161 milligrams. The coffee could have other holes, depending on the type of coffee; for example, espresso contains significant amounts of niacin and riboflavin, which have one and three rings in their chemical structure, respectively.\nThis estimation depends on taking the ball-and-stick model of molecules somewhat literally. However, real molecular bonds are not solid sticks, but shared electron clouds between atoms. The \"holes\" in the middle of a molecule's rings are not completely empty but instead merely have lower electron probability density through the middle than other parts of the bonds. So the point-cloud duality of electron orbitals and bonds might not satisfy a topologist's, normal person's, or philosopher's criteria for a connected substrate in which holes may be formed.\nIn the title text, a theoretical physicist looks even deeper, at the subatomic scale of Planck units . Since fundamental particle interaction is governed by fundamental forces and collision (per the Pauli exclusion principle ) instead of tensile or ductile solid connectedness, the theoretical physicist posits that any definition providing for a single hole would also describe a number of holes akin to the factorial of the number of particles in the universe, [1] or at least within the cup's light cone , which is a number impractical to accurately count, but not uncountable in a mathematical sense.\nThe main joke is that the number of holes depends on both the scale and perspective from which you are looking at the world. From a topological standpoint, when someone digs into the ground it should go all the way through (or easier, down and up again another place) before it is considered a hole, since a hole is something that some other thing should be able to pass through. But from a common usage perspective, if people dig in the ground the result is called a hole, because functionally it creates a discontinuity in to which, for example, things can be placed or fall. Similarly, the opening in a coffee cup without a handle or a bottle of beer is called a hole, even though they are topologically equivalent to a dinner plate, which normal people would never say had a hole.\nA cavity in a surface could also be considered a physical barrier, preventing movement along the surface in certain scenarios (e.g. a sinkhole opening up in the middle of a road) even though it may be topologically 'flat' in the most general way, and so is very open to context, and such a hole might be considered more a 'thing' than the surface that has been removed to create it. And a concavity in a vessel that can hold liquid (or a drilled hole which removes that ability) is of a different nature from the holes in the molecules that are part of the liquid therein. And such holes very different from the string-theoretical holes at the Planck scale, which don't necessarily involve barriers, containment, or any other aspects of topological connectivity. This conceptual ambiguity of what a hole is or means is demonstrated by the fictional portable hole , which obeys and defies a normal person's preconceptions of a hole.\nThe topological discussion here regarding cups and doughnuts is related to the question of how many holes there are in a human, which is excellently answered in Vsauce's video How Many Holes Does a Human Have? . This also takes a good look at the topological difference between a paper cup and a mug with handle, and how one could be morphed into a plate and the other into a doughnut.\n[The first panel has text only and is phrasing a question:] Q: How many holes are there in a coffee cup?\n[Each of the next four panels has a caption at the top to indicate the kind of person answering the question. In the first of these Ponytail stands holding a coffee cup in its handle.] Caption: Topologist Ponytail: One.\n[In the next panel Hairy stands to the right of Ponytail, holding the coffee cup in its handle at an angle so he can to look into it.] Caption: Normal person Hairy: IDK, does the opening count as a hole?\n[In the next panel Hairbun is shown in closeup, holding her hand out palm up to indicate two drawings of coffee cups with handles to her left. The top drawing is larger and shows the cup with coffee inside, and a hole drilled at the bottom part of the side away from the handle. Coffee pours out of this hole. Beneath and further left is a smaller version of the same cup, but now without coffee. Instead two curved arrows goes from above to below through the hole of the handle and the hole now drilled in the bottom part of the cup. Each arrow is labeled with a question-mark.] Caption: Philosopher Hairbun: To answer that question, consider another: If we drill a hole in the side, how many holes are there now? ? ?\n[Cueball, without any cup, stands with a drawing of a caffeine molecule above and to the right of him.

There are 9 \"edges\" on this, three of those has one atom attached to it and 3 others have four atoms attached to them (one atom with three others attached). The two that are at the end of the edge that belongs to both rings have no atoms attached, and the final of the 9 also has no atom.] Caption: Chemist Cueball: 10 21 in the caffeine alone\n"}

In this comic, Randall addresses the issue with a deliberately suboptimal internet device that drops Internet connectivity intermittently and at unpredictable intervals, thereby causing activities that require a constant, uninterrupted connection to be unusable. The device appears to be an internet modem connected to an automated version of a Galton board or Jin Akiyama 's mathematical pachinko machine [1] with a series of twelve switches at the bottom to be pressed by falling balls, eleven of which are linked to a the label \"on\" and one linked to a second label \"off,\" both such sets of switches apparently controlling the connection. This solves the social problem of demands for the likes of synchronous teleconferencing , by causing asynchronous methods of communication to be relatively more reliable and efficient for personal use.\nThis is funny because such a device could likely much more easily be implemented in the firmware of the internet or WiFi modem or routers . (See 1785: Wifi for an explanation of firmware.) It's not clear whether the switches merely interrupt the connection momentarily or control power to the modem, which would involve a much longer booting sequence. The \"unreliable\" connection provides an excuse to be unavailable for work or social calls, and thus free to enjoy one's vacation. However the device also allows the user to have a fast internet connection most of the time, enabling them to use it for leisure purposes, such as downloading movies for entertainment, or to connect with others on one's own terms. It thus retains most of the benefit of a good connection.\nThe probability of a ball hitting the \"off\" switch is 165\/2048, or about 8% (assuming the machine is ordinary, [2] and the space between switches is disregarded) because it's in the ninth position. We don't know the frequency with which new balls are dropped, so we can't estimate the frequency at which the device is likely to trigger Session Initiation Protocol , Transmission Control Protocol , or similar timeout conditions that would likely close synchronous VOIP , video conferencing, and e.g. VRChat connections. Even if such connections were to survive the induced service interruptions, the application layer call or teleconference quality would suffer during them. The device may cause interruptions rarely enough that the connection is usable for casual purposes, but the user can still reasonably claim that it's unreliable to get out of online obligations.\nThe title text reflects on today's increasingly always-connected world, where emphasis may be changing from finding rare vacation spots that have reliable internet, to now finding somewhere worthwhile to go that still doesn't have it. It could also be a comment on the mild paradox that a nominally unreliable internet connection has advantages for those whose communication schedule, volume, or style preferences make synchronous teleconferencing less practical, desirable, or both. The reviews for the new vacation spot indicate that disconnections are found to be both desirable and undesirable, possibly even by the same person.\n[There are twelve switches under an automated Galton board or pachinko machine, eleven of which are linked to a large item marked \"on\" but the ninth of which is linked to one marked \"off\", apparently controlling the operation of a modem connected to a gigabit data-cable and also connected onwards to a WiFi router.

White Hat (wearing a white boater) has seemingly just finished introducing a topic of discussion to the rest of the group; he knows the rest of his group will find the topic weird, but is willing to defend Gen Z with the excuse \"that's just how they do things.\" Black Hat is expressing a notion that sounds a lot like juvenoia , and is quick to make sweeping generalizations about the younger group.  The other reactions depicted are representative of the broader spectrum of possible responses: either surprised interest or cautious acceptance. There is no evidence that White Boater is correct about how Gen-Z does things.\nNeither knee-jerk rejection nor forward-looking sympathy are specifically praised by the main text of the comic, but the example highlighted in the title text seems to imply that Randall would like to emphasize openness to new things.\nThe title text quotes a newspaper from Elk Falls, Kansas, which on May 18, 1905, told of a \"Parisian fad\".  The item was a shortened version of an account which also ran in many other newspapers.  In this case, the \"fad\" is the introduction of yogurt (spelled \"yaghurt\" in this publication, probably because English spelling of the word was not standardized yet and may have been influenced by the French spelling (\"yaourt\") and phonology).  In the modern day, yogurt is enjoyed as a common food in most cultures , but in 1905 the concept was bizarre and repulsive to many readers.  This shows that things which are dismissed as \"strange\" because of preconceived notions of a particular group (that curdled milk is necessarily bad) may, in fact, be perfectly acceptable once more context is obtained.  It is also worth noting that yogurt was not invented in 1905, but had existed for centuries prior; despite this, the recent introduction to French culture is what prompted its recognition as a nascent \"fad\".  This may be analogized to various fads and trends which Gen Z is embracing which may appear unfounded to members of older generations, but which nevertheless represent acceptance of ideas which did not originate with members of that generation.  Randall may have chosen this particular version of the item in part because it omits some of the statements in the longer item, such as that consumption of yogurt could \u201cprolong human life to what is its normal span - a century or so.\u201d\nThis is not the first comic to identify \"modern\" complaints or viewpoints as having been present throughout history in various forms (see comics 1227: The Pace of Modern Life and 1601: Isolation ).\nThe humor in making generalizations about people born in specific time periods is also seen in 973: MTV Generation , 1962: Generations and 2249: I Love the 20s .\n[Six individuals in clothing representing early 1900s' American fashion stand in a line.

The what if? blog as well as both books gives answers to odd or strange science questions. Clicking on the link in the comic will take you to the link. Clicking anywhere on the comic will do the same. It has been a general thing for Randall to comment on the fact that he does not know how to make only part of an image into a link, which he also did recently in the xkcd Header text .\nIn general, there are very narrow ranges of temperature, pressure, and chemical makeup humans can survive in. Human physicists necessarily spend all their time in these conditions and think of them as ordinary. The physics of these ordinary conditions has already been thoroughly studied, which makes them now familiar and boring. Instead physicists get excited to study more extreme conditions, most of which would be quickly lethal to humans \u2014 anything from the event horizons of black holes to the vacuum of space, to volumes where charged particles traveling near the speed of light are forced to collide, and many, many things in between. Thus, extreme conditions are very dangerous for most organisms. Even for especially resilient organisms, such as tardigrades, there is a point past which they will stop being biology and start being physics , in which case their resilience will not save them. Thus if a physicist is excited about something, it likely exists in circumstances where your own existence \u2014 as well as other life \u2014 would meet an end. One (partial) exception is particle beams; people can stick their heads in particle beams and survive \u2014 but not unscathed .

The rope is attached ( tethered ) to the pole on one end and to a ball on the other end. The players try to wind the rope in opposite directions and do so by hitting the ball at the rope's loose end with their hands or with paddles. Randall has the usual configuration last with five stars, preceded by several humorously inane configurations with fewer stars:\nGround-rope-ball receives only one star because there is no way to keep \"score\". Megan holds the rope while looking at Cueball holding the ball. What to do...\nGround-pole-ball receives only one star because there is no way for anything to happen. The pole is fixed in place, and the ball is fixed in place at the top. Ponytail can be seen waving her hand at the ball at the top of the pole, but it's too tall and she can't even reach it. Hairbun has just given up.\nGround-rope-pole-ball is slightly better than the previous configurations and therefore receives two stars instead of one. The players have some way to keep score by seeing which way the rope is wound around the pole, but a player who is behind can reset the score by pushing the rope windings off of the rope. Also, twirling the rope in order to rack up point windings would be awkward\u2014and possibly even dangerous to the other player, depending on how long the pole is. Lastly, the ball serves no purpose in this case. Ponytail holds the rope while White Hat holds the ball from which the pole goes up.\nGround-pole-rope-ball is the best and therefore receives five stars. Players can accumulate point windings by hitting the ball past the other player, and gravity and the pole's height prevent the player who is behind from unscrupulously resetting the score. This is the configuration that is used in real life. Back to Cueball and Megan, who are getting ready to play a regular game of Tetherball.\nIn the title text a fifth alternative is mentioned, where there is no rope, and instead a second pole rotates freely around a joint made out of a ball: Ground-pole-ball-pole is mentioned to be fun, because if you shake the pole stuck in the ground, the loose one connected via the ball could begin whipping around dangerously. Whether this is actually entertaining depends on whether you get hit by it... Again, You would not be able to keep score in the same way as regular tetherball, but you could count who got hit by the second loose pole first, or, for instance, the first to 10 hits. Alternatively, you could score a point by managing to make the free pole make a complete rotation without your opponent managing to change its direction. If the pole is not padded, or made of a soft material, this would likely be dangerous, [ citation needed ] or at least painful. Randall also remarks that the ball would probably get torn apart as it acts like a joint between the two poles. No rating is given, but, given that he calls it fun, at least 3 stars might be expected.\n[Four panels show four different configurations in which the elements of a tetherball game could be connected.

Meteorologists and physicists on Earth might notice that such exoplanet atmospheres do not obey formal Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics , but instead reflect low-quality corner-cutting of such calculations, such as exhibiting only smooth laminar flow instead of turbulence , its alternative. The foregoing would make sense if the Universe is actually simulated by a computer (a 43% probability [4] ) and the being(s) who are running the physics simulator, or have coded our universe, wanted to speed things up.\nOf course, most people do not think that the Universe is a simulation, [ actual citation needed ] but society does not know that it isn't a simulation with absolute certainty. There is a direct relationship between the question of the simulation hypothesis in metaphysics and Pascal's wager in theism , i.e., whether God(s) exist(s), with weighty implications regarding free will and determinism , such as which raise the question of non-naturalist compatibilism .\nMegan proposes an additional theory that the universe is intended to make cool swirly clouds, and that the presence of life to observe these clouds is a bothersome coincidence. This goes against the theory that the Universe must not care about making cool swirly clouds since it wants to skimp on their fluid dynamics calculations. Even among followers of the simulation hypothesis, ascribing sentiment, emotion, or motivations to the entire universe is usually considered to be in jest, because of the dissimilarities between sentient beings and cosmologically distant sets of galaxies. [ citation needed ] This jest forms the basis of the comic's humor. Neither ascribing motivations to the Universe nor positing the purpose of a constructed simulation of our reality are falsifiable hypotheses subject to scientific inquiry, although they may imply logical and mathematical inferences.\nThe title text includes a dialogue with one person asking another why they got into fluid dynamics. The answer implies that the motivation was to simulate the clouds of planetary atmospheres unreachable by today's rocket technology.\n[Cueball and Megan standing on a field, looking out at a landscape of clouds] Cueball: It's weird to think there are countless planets with air and stuff but no life. Cueball: Billions of years of clouds making cool shapes with no one to look at them.\n[Just Cueball and Megan standing next to each other] Megan: Yeah, it seems like a waste. The universe getting the complex fluid dynamics right for every momentary swirl of cloud. Megan: Just a huge amount of work.\n[Cueball and Megan walk away to the right] Cueball: Maybe atmospheres have smooth laminar flow until someone looks closely. Megan: Or maybe the universe just likes making swirly clouds, and is annoyed that we're watching.\n"}

These songs usually either praise the United States for its perceived virtues or mock it for its perceived flaws. Regardless of the content of the song, one could likely sing such songs replacing each usage of the word \"America\" or \"American\" with another four-syllable word or phrase with emphasis on the second syllable, without disrupting the cadence or meter of the song. Words and phrases like this are said to \" scan \" with the word \"America,\" which means to conform to that metrical pattern.\nThe comic provides a list of such names, most of which are locations. While some share virtues or flaws with the United States, most would fit into songs about the United States poorly, and only some are prominent enough to justify a song praising or mocking them. So the substitution is humorous for most of the examples. Other examples include Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Liberia, Nigeria, Bolivia, Siberia, Somalia, Albania, Bulgaria, Colombia, Cambodia, Armenia, Australia, Dominica, Estonia, Mongolia, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, South Africa, El Salvador, the Alamo, the Netherlands, and the Philippines.\nNote that inhabitants of some real-world locations mentioned in this comic do not pronounce their names in a way that scans with \"America\". Also note that the adjective form of many of the places listed either does not exist or does not fit the same rhythmic structure as \"American\". (For instance, while \"Antarctican Idiot\" scans with \"American Idiot\", \"St. Petersburgian Idiot\" does not; meanwhile, \"Canada\" does not scan with \"America\", but \"Canadian\" does scan with \"American\" and was in fact used as such in Weird Al's parody, \" Canadian Idiot \".) In these cases, it would be necessary to use the noun form of the name to preserve the song's meter.\nThe title text provides an example: substituting \" Jurassic Park \" for \"America\" in the song \" America the Beautiful \".\nA similar comparison in \"scanning\" was made in 1412: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles .\n[A header is written above a map of the US mainland:] Places whose names scan to \"America,\" so they can be substituted into songs such as: America the Beautiful God Bless America Neil Diamond \u2013 America West Side Story \u2013 America The Guess Who \u2013 American Woman Green Day \u2013 American Idiot [Above the map, towards the left:] Sasketchewan [Towards the right:] Ontario [A number of places are marked on the map.

Some of these have become well-known in popular culture; while some are deliberately open-ended, several others are presented as a choice between two or more options, and are assumed to have a single answer, the debate being about which is correct. In this comic, Randall proposes that the answers to these questions are instead not fixed, but vary according to a tiered subscription business model , as seen in many business pricing schemes, particularly in software. In this model, the no-cost tier gets you a universe experience of a lower quality, while at higher tiers better options are available for a cost - for example in the highest tier the processes of aging and death are \"Opt-in\" rather than \"Mandatory\". It is not clear from the comic who is supposed to be paying these subscription fees, or to whom they are paid (presumably the developers or maintainers of the universe, or the hypothesized simulation thereof ), or whose experience of the universe is supposed to be affected.\nThe universe does not have a subscription model, but on the chart  some of the categories that refer to observable properties such as the speed limit or existence of the Uncertainty Principle indicate ours is the Universe Standard\u00ae subscription. Other specified settings may not entirely match our user experience. Possibly a high-tier installation has the option to restrict itself to selected lower-tier behaviours, if it is considered more useful.\nThe title text refers to the concept of T-symmetry in physical laws. Most properties of our universe are asymmetric, meaning that the property changes if time is reversed (e.g. the entropy of the universe decreases as time flows backwards). Randall again makes a reference to software subscription models in a play on words as the Universe Pro\u00ae\u2122 sub appears to have laws that maintain \"backwards compatibility\".\nGiven that Universe Standard is most in-line with the non-facetious observations, and assuming the price tag has not changed since day one, whoever is paying for this subscription has paid 2.470 \u00d7 10 12 dollars, given that current estimates place the age of the universe at 13.77 billion years old. .\n[A table with three columns, labelled \"Universe Lite\u2122\", \"Universe Standard\u00ae\", and \"Universe Pro\u00ae\u2122\".

Cueball: Every time I reply to someone, I think Cueball: What if this is their Green Day moment?\n","explanation":"In this comic, Cueball , very likely as an autobiographical representation of Randall , describes to Megan the first time he interacted with a group of people unknown to him over the internet; in an AOL chat room for children called the \"KOOL Tree House chat room\" in 1993, when Randall was about nine years old. He read a discussion about Green Day , asked who they are, and was told that not knowing was a serious problem. As Megan says, judging people for lack of pop culture knowledge has remained typical online behavior.\nGreen Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987.  In 1993, they were still known merely as an independent punk band, and a year away from releasing their major-label debut album Dookie , their first mainstream success. Anyone, especially a nine year-old, not recognizing the band in 1993 would be perfectly normal. After 1993, Green Day would go on to be a widely popular and influential rock band with many acclaimed albums.\nThis initial online social interaction was a significant formative experience for Cueball, molding his online behavior ever since, in that it still causes him to consider his correspondents' perspectives when communicating. The social dynamics at play are reminiscent of the mathematics of others' perspectives described in 1053: Ten Thousand . Relating the personal experience of an oversized effect from a casual insult is humorous because the extent to which early experiences affect people can be both ironic and profound.\nThe title text indicates Cueball agrees with the reply to the question. This is humorous because it is effectively Cueball admitting that something is very wrong with him, possibly coincidental with and unrelated to knowing that specific piece of trivia. Alternatively, Cueball could have come to believe Green Day is culturally important. If this story is autobiographical, Randall could have hence become a Green Day fan, or at least acquired more than a passing knowledge of their \u0153uvre , recently mentioning their song \" American Idiot \" in 2665: America Songs .\n[First panel, Megan and Cueball talking] Cueball: You know, Cueball: I remember the first thing anybody ever said to me on the internet.

The surface is depicted with characteristic craters and rocks with a slightly curved horizon. The rocket is standing in the left part of the panel. A short ladder leads down from a hatch in the lower part of the rocket body. An astronaut has stepped down from a ladder onto the Moon's surface, and is speaking:]\nAstronaut: This is one of my favorite historical quotes \u2014 the first words spoken by an Artemis astronaut on the Moon.\n[Caption beneath the panel:] Neil Armstrong's \"man\"\/\"a man\" quote created a lot of historical confusion, and I think it's our duty to expand on that legacy with Artemis.\n","explanation":"The Artemis program is a series of planned space missions that will land people on the Moon and begin to set up infrastructure for a permanent crewed presence. People first landed on the Moon in 1969 as part of the Apollo program . They have not been back since 1972. When Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon, he famously said, \"That's one small step for man; one giant leap for mankind.\" However, he was intending to say, \"That's one small step for a man; one giant leap for mankind [emphasis added].\" The audio recording omits the word \"a\", making the sentence confusing, as \"man\" and \"mankind\" have the same meaning when referring to all people.\nThat the word was apparently elided by Armstrong in the excitement, changing the meaning of the historical phrase, is controversial and thus humorous. Subsequently, Armstrong and others have blamed insufficiently tuned voice activity detection hardware circuitry intended to save power in radio voice transmission, but NASA engineers, third-party historians and their hired experts have never been able to corroborate that explanation. [1] [2] Armstrong later said he hoped, \"history would grant me leeway for dropping the syllable and understand that it was certainly intended, even if it was not said,\" and, on p.126 of the June 1982 edition of Omni, \"the 'a' is implied, so I'm happy if they just put it in parentheses.\"\nRandall suggests that the first Artemis astronaut to set foot on the Moon has a duty to utter an even more confusing quote, saying the sentence, \"This is one of my favorite historical quotes \u2014 the first words spoken by an Artemis astronaut on the moon,\" aloud as they step onto the Moon. That would be confusingly self-referential, as if they were alluding to something from the past. The phrasing would also be confusing to a person hearing it quoted, as it would sound more like a statement about the quote than the actual quote itself. This is very unlikely, and funny merely as a recommendation. If it actually happened, it might be both hilarious and scandalous.\nWhile the comic's lunar lander has similarities to the current plans for the Artemis lander, [3] it is a generic drawing, perhaps in homage to classic space science fiction, with the exit portal at an unlikely position near the base of the SpaceX Starship lander. [4]\nThe title text suggests an alternate phrase by which the Artemis astronaut could say being the first (rather than 13th) human on the Moon is a great honor. People hearing this quote in the future could assume that Artemis was the first crewed mission to the Moon. It could feed into contemporary conspiracy theories that the Apollo landings were faked, furthering the confusion.\nThis comic coincides with the canceled launch of Artemis 1 , an uncrewed test mission which will serve as the start of the Artemis program. The mission was intended to launch on 29 August 2022, and later on 3 September 2022, but was repeatedly postponed due to a series of technical problems. It finally launched on November 16th. On December 13th, the spacecraft successfully splashed down back on Earth.\nIn 893: 65 Years , Randall made a graph showing the number of living people who had been on the moon, and estimated the day when zero would be alive. At that time 9 of the 12 were still alive. Upon this comic's release, only four are still among the living.\n[A vertical rocket is standing on four deployed legs on the surface of the Moon.

Car entertainment systems and SatNav -enabling devices (if connected to the car's audio feed) typically allow the SatNav to interrupt whatever else is being played, so that directions can be heard clearly. It's usually easy for the driver to recognise such instructions due to the sudden change in characteristics of the voice and the switch in contextual flow. However, if the synthetic voice is similar to the speech that was playing, it may be hard to distinguish between the two, especially if the navigation instructions seem to coincide with the interrupted speech. In cases like this, the listener might think that the driving instructions are part of their podcast.\nCueball is interviewing Ponytail for the podcast, and she tells a story about a woman who betrayed her. Just when she is about to tell what the betraying woman said to her before she left with the money, which might have revealed if it had been planned in advance, the GPS instructions interrupts and delivers a driving instruction blocking out the last part of a sentence.\nThe comic suggests Randall misinterpreted those driving instructions as part of the story being told in the podcast because the GPS voice sounds similar to Ponytail's voice. The comic illustrates the instructions as if they were part of the story from the podcast. Due to the mysterious nature of the story, it is conceivable that the woman in the podcast could have said the navigation instruction line as part of the podcast, leading to an even more humorous ambiguity between the two. The driving instruction does not really fit into the story.\nThe title text suggests this confusion worsened after Randall's navigation instructions voice got stuck emulating Phoebe Judge , known for the Criminal and This Is Love podcasts, implying he often listens to her. The extent to which she may sound similar to voices of common navigation apps is of course entirely subjective. In Randall's case, however, his GPS used Judge's voice, so the potential for confusion became greater.\n[Cueball and Ponytail are facing each other from opposite sides of a table.

The camera and the display both have limited resolutions, so the detail of the original screenshot at the center of the image will be reduced as it approaches the range of a few pixels, hence the original image will be lost before it reaches the sub-pixel range. This is funny because the default resolution of contemporary camera phones can be too large to meet size requirements for e.g. mobile phone Multimedia Messaging Service , web file uploads, or email attachments, so one or two steps of this awkward procedure are sometimes necessary.\nFor a fuller explanation of the concepts involved, including Planck units , often associated with the topological quantum foam of string theory , please see this CGP Grey video. For an explanation of topological string theory, see 2658: Coffee Cup Holes . Please see also 1683: Digital Data for an analogous image processing concept.\nThe title text refers to producing photographically likely higher resolution images from lower resolutions, an active area of current research. [1] Because reducing the resolution of an image is a lossy process, results obtained through such processes will not be able to perfectly recreate the original. Machine learning can be used to calculate how images of known photographic subjects (or e.g. anime-style art, in the case of waifu2x ) behave under certain types of noise or reduction in size, so that images of those kinds can be upscaled in a way that, if not perfectly recreating the original, at least is a faithful representation, but when the image is scaled all the way down to one pixel, everything except a small amount of data about the image's overall color is lost, making reconstructing the original image impossible. Randall disclaims that, because the AI upscaling is based on ingesting a large corpus of human-made art (with subjects that we find 'interesting' or at least meaningful being predominantly represented), the AI will produce an image that is at least as cool as the original image was, and in fact some image generation AIs actually work on a similar principle \u2014 for example, \"reverse diffusion\" AIs are trained by teaching them to reconstruct images from noise, at which they can produce entirely new images by being fed actual noise.  He could also be making a pun on color temperature , which the upscaler will be able to match to the original image. The \" enhance button \" for upscaling images is a common trope in movies and television, especially in crime and science fiction stories.\nThe scale reduction caused by a rotation can be approximated. If a is the width of the picture and b its height, the reduction is x=a\/b , the aspect ratio of the picture rectangle. As can be seen in the comic, the first rotation leaves two gray areas on each side of the picture that are roughly square. The width of the reduced picture is x.a = a 2\/ b . Each gray area is a (high) by ( b-x.a )\/2 (wide). This is roughly square, but will not be exactly square unless\nb = 2 a + x.a and since x=a\/b , dividing by b we obtain 1 = 2 x + x\u00b2.\nThis is a quadratic equation, whose only positive solution is \u221a2-1 \u2248 0.414\nReturning to the general problem: the reduction is geometric, so that after nine rotations, the picture will be reduced by a factor of x \u2079. Since this is \"smaller than a pixel\", the original screen resolution is fewer than (1\/ x )\u2079 pixels. It is not stated whether it is the width, height, or area of the original picture that have been reduced to \"smaller than a pixel\".\n25 rotations reduces a lot further and logarithms are useful to compute that. Let L be log( a \/ b ), a negative number since a \/ b is less than 1. If the original screen is 10cm wide, its reduced picture will be x ^25 times smaller in width. The comic tells us that the picture is now \"smaller than an atom\" (typically 10^-10m). If referring to the width, then 25 L is less than about -9.0 using base-10 logarithms.\nAfter 101 rotations, the reduction will be x ^101, and the picture is now \"smaller than the Planck length \". The log of the Planck length is about -34.8, so 101 L is less than -33.8.\nSignificantly we know that 100 rotations was not enough, so 100 L is greater than -33.8. If we split the difference and say that 100.5 L is equal to -33.8, we get an aspect ratio a \/ b just about 0.461. Multiple popular phone sizes are within the range, including the iPhone X or XS both with an aspect ratio of 1125\/2436 ~ 0.4618.\n[A phone in portrait orientation shows an image of Cueball standing. It is then rotated, showing the image smaller with bars in landscape orientation, then the next phone is in portrait showing the entire screen of the previous rotated sideways, shrinking it every time. An arrow points from each phone to the phone with the next smaller image, until the last one. The labels, at the 9th, 25th, and 101st rotation, show the decreasing size of the original image as it goes through successive rotations.]\n[Labels:] 9 rotations: original image is smaller than a pixel.\n25 rotations: original image is smaller than an atom.\n101 rotations: original image is smaller than the Planck length, at which the concept of distance may break down.\n[Bottom caption:] Phone tip: don't rotate and screenshot an image too many times or it will become lost in the quantum foam of the universe.\n"}

The comic thus appeared on a Tuesday, replacing that week's normal Wednesday release to coincide with the release day. The xkcd Header text also changed that day to shout out that the book was released on that day. (It had been counting down the last week, from less than a week , three days and one day while the previous comics 2670: Interruption and 2671: Rotation was on the front page \u2014 the latter only for one day due to the Tuesday release).\nWhile announcing that his What If? 2 book is finally out (the entire comic is a link to the books page on xkcd), Randall gives us a flowchart we can follow to find an article in the book relating to the situation in the flowchart. Once a relevant possibility is reached in the flowchart a page number in the book is given. It thus assumes the reader plans to do something that the advice in What If 2 could be helpful for, which hopefully is highly unlikely. See the table below for explanations on the individual options in the flowchart.\nThe title text refers to the loop near the bottom of the flowchart, which involves a series of questions asking if the reader wants a progressively larger number of dogs. The number of dogs offered increases several times, and if that is sufficient the flowchart ends with fulfillment. Eventually it will have an option for the scenario where all in the universe is consumed by dogs, which directs to page 308 of the book. The title text references this last option by assuring the reader that all of the dogs are doing fine, but goes on to state that in itself could cause problems. For instance, those dogs could impede the progress of all life on Earth and elsewhere and\/or reproduce and create an even larger population of dogs.\nThe flowchart questions and their possible answers are described in the following table(Also in 2672: What If? 2 Flowchart\/Table ):\n[A large flowchart, with the first box in the top left corner.] Box 1: Congratulations, you have acquired a copy of What if? 2!

Serve in shot glasses.\n","explanation":"This comic describes a recipe to approximate the molecular composition of certain mRNA -based vaccines, in drinkable form. It contains the variety and relative concentrations of the simple molecular constituents found in the injectable mixture. Coronavirus mRNA vaccines contain mostly water, with some mRNA, a few fats (e.g., a PEGylated lipid and cholesterol), sugar (sucrose), and tromethamine buffer to stabilize pH. [1] The cocktail contains mostly water, some sugar, fats, either an amino acid salt or biological and genetic material, and the other constituents of mayonnaise .\nThe word cocktail in the context of drugs can mean several things, including medically designed combinations of drugs. [2] That's not so far in concept from the current formulation of COVID-19 booster, which targets both the original and BA.5 variants of the virus.\nLike much of what we eat or drink, the stomach and intestines will neutralize much of the complexity of either the vaccines or this ersatz replica of them, reducing them to simpler components of some nutritional value. For the vaccine to work, it has been designed to be injected into the body e.g. intramuscularly to bypass the hostile environment of the human digestive system. While there are similar vaccines administered as a nasal spray, the fragility of mRNA in the digestive system has curtailed the search for ingestible analogs. Randall 's replacement mixture is nontoxic, and contains water, proteins and calories, all important nutritional components. Because it doesn't contain a complete spectrum of essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, [3] you can't live on it alone.\nThe CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is the US national public health agency.  They make recommendations about vaccine use. Dr. Anthony Fauci has been the chief infectious disease advisor to numerous US Presidents and has often been interviewed regarding COVID-19 vaccines.\nThe instruction to serve in shot glasses is a play on words, as \"shot\" can mean injection in medicine. One jigger is only 0.19 of a cup, so the recipe serves up to five.\nThe title text suggests the mixture can be served as a \"booster\" to a prior dose. The comic recommends not redosing within two months of the last attempt.  The current mRNA coronavirus booster is approved for use at least 2 months after previous immunization.  Too little time between doses of a vaccine may reduce benefit from the booster.  However most pairs of distinct vaccines work well if delivered on the same day. [ actual citation needed ]\nThis comic coincided with the widespread availability of the bivalent COVID vaccines in the US. It's another entry in a series of comics related to the COVID-19 pandemic , specifically regarding the COVID-19 vaccine . It was, however, almost a year since the vaccines were mentioned last in 2532: Censored Vaccine Card , released almost 11 month before this one, and more than 8 months since the last comic to directly feature COVID-19, which was 2563: Throat and Nasal Passages , that came out as the first comic in 2022.

The notion is that a relatively small number of versatile items, designed to be easily portable, can prepare you for a wide variety of possible situations.  Typical items include such things as wallets, cell phones, small flashlights, pocketknives and multi-tools. Items specific to a person's occupation, lifestyle, or other needs might also be included.\nWhile the concept of regularly carrying items that you might need is a very old one, the abbreviation \"EDC\" has come to signify a subculture, well-represented on the internet which promotes self-reliance and preparedness for almost any situation. As with so many subcultures, this movement has spawned a thriving market in selling products explicitly intended for \"being carried every day\". Any internet search will reveal thousands of products, of various levels of quality and utility, marketed to people interested in EDC. Stylized pocketknives, 'tactical' flashlights, and tools purporting to fulfill multiple functions are common examples.\nRather than carefully consider the relative advantages of each of these pieces of gear, Cueball seems to have taken the advertising of such items at face value: he's purchased them all, and attempts to carry them all with him every day. The result is that he has so many items that he not only needs to wear a heavily augmented backpack, he also needs to drag around a cart carrying boxes and a massive bag, presumably filled with the thousands of pieces of gear he's purchased. Such a strategy obviously defeats the original purpose of EDC, which is to select a set of items that's both portable and useful, but such is the result of taking internet marketing literally.\nIn the title text, he expresses confidence that he'll be vindicated by encountering a situation in which his massive collection of items will be useful. He also makes clear that, having bought all the items available, his collection is wildly redundant, having hundreds of flashlights and pocketknives.  While it's quite common to encounter a situation in which a knife or flashlight is needed (sometimes even two might be useful), a situation where hundreds would be useful is difficult to imagine. One use might be a very dangerous LARP cloud of daggers.\n[Cueball is standing and straining backwards, dragging a large sack nearly the size as him, with noticeable bulges.

Failing to follow it might make the aircraft crash or suffer other problems. As a mnemonic device, all the activities end in -ate .\nBy deferring less important activities until the prior need is deemed satisfied, the immediate dangers of flight into terrain ( uncontrolled and controlled flight into terrain ) are reduced \u2014 as the pilot's current circumstances allow \u2014 and yet can provide for addressing other hazards .\nRandall humorously \"extends\" this standard list with other -ate checklist items that pilots could do if they're not too busy aviating, navigating and communicating. These extra tasks range from somewhat hilarious to physically impossible or dangerous; see the table below for explanations. These actions should generally not be taken , as they could distract the pilot and prevent them from reaching the cabin in case of an emergency, or vaporize everyone inside along with portions of the airframe.\nThe title text adds another -ate item to the checklist: Celebrate, whereupon congratulatory cakes are served to the passengers. The \"inverted tiers\" refers to the airspace class diagram used in the United States, used by planes circling over airports. The class diagram starts with a small circle over the airport and then becomes wider in one or two steps at higher altitudes. When depicted graphically, this looks like an inverted tiered cake , as opposed to a regular tiered cake . Randall suggests that after having congratulated yourself for flying an aircraft, you could then celebrate by serving the passengers cakes in this inverted shape. It would, however, be unsuitable for an aircraft to serve cakes that are smaller at the bottom than at the top because of turbulence.\n[A list with ten numbered points are shown.

At the top of the hologram are two lines of text, above \"1899\" are three lines of text, above \"1970\" is one line of text, below \"1899\" are two lines of text, and below \"1970\" is one line of text; all of these lines of text are illegible.] Blondie: Historical records show millions of business transactions occurred on Dec 30 th , 1899. Blondie: This economic activity sparked the digital age, culminating in a \"data festival\" on Jan 1 st , 1970, when many early digital files were created.\n[Caption under the panel:] It's going to be weird when historians forget why some dates show up a lot.\n","explanation":"Many files and database entries contain a date. When it is not set, it often defaults to the first day in the system. The two dates listed below are mentioned as \"significant\" in the comic.\nDec 30th, 1899 comes from a spreadsheet date compatibility issue between Excel and Lotus 1-2-3 (referenced in the title text.) Spreadsheets store dates as sequential numbers so that they can be used in calculations. In Excel, by default, January 1, 1900 is number 1 [1] . Based on that, Excel's integer date representation would be the number of days that have passed since December 31, 1899.  However, because of a bug intentionally carried over from Lotus 1-2-3 where it counts February 29, 1900 as a day even though it actually was not [2] , for any day since then, Excel's integer date representation is actually the number of days that have passed since December 30, 1899.  Most other spreadsheet applications copied the behavior of Excel to maintain compatibility with it. This leads to the value of 0 in some applications (notably Open- and LibreOffice Calc and Google Spreadsheets) being interpreted as Dec 30th, 1899. Similarly, Microsoft Visual Basic and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) interpret 0.0 as Dec 30th, 1899.\nThe historian in the comic presents some research wrongly based only on the number of entries created on those dates. This confusion on the part of the future historian only grows in the title text, where they make the claim that Lotus 1-2-3 is, in fact, religious imagery related to some sort of deity, potentially a lotus god, around whom the '1899 event' took place. This may be poking fun at the trope that anthropologists attribute any behavior they can't explain to religious ritual.

This may include the use of a nuclear briefcase , where a verification process involves secondary authority figures other than the primary one.  However, this illustration more clearly refers to the kind of procedure used at a launch site where two duty officers each need to turn their respective keys simultaneously. The physical distance between the keys ensures that an individual cannot turn both keys similtaneously, or initiate the sequence without the second person.\nIn relation to software development, the inconvenience prevented by such precautions (like account passwords and two-factor authentication ) has prompted the development of methods to make the process easier (like autofilling passwords or website cookies keeping a user logged in for multiple visits). Similarly, the system in the comic is made more convenient by using a dual key-turner that circumvents the need for two users to turn the keys.\nAnd thus we find out that the thing used to make the safeguards less of a nuisance actually defeats the purpose of the safeguards. As with website passwords, where the use of a computer or device by someone else could allow them to use the autologin capabilities, or even to view all passwords used locally and take away for their own use, the whole point of the deliberately included security factor has been negated. It was only the perceived need for two independent operators that created the initial situation of requiring two separated keys, or indeed any keys at all!\nHence, after a further cycle of development, in order to restore the security of the two-key system, the two-key turning device (rather than being removed or made unworkable) is provided for use but only if it can be removed from a secure cabinet (labelled as giving access to the 'key turner', much as the original unit was labelled as giving access to a missile) with the requirements to open it being\u2026 \u2026two seperate keys to be used at the same time! This could be seen as the same as password managers being introduced, either as a part of a browser or third-party add-ons, which automatically provide the user's passwords for any given access attempt but only when they are given a password (or other security factor) themselves.\nAnd so, rather than removing a 'problem', a new safeguard is added which does the exact same thing as the original, the possible nuisance (but hopefully also the necessary element of security) included.\nPassword management, as a process, is substantially similar to key management: Common failure-modes for both passwords and keys, include forgetting your own long-term passwords (especially if you changed computers after asking your computer to remember your passwords for you) which is functionally similar to misplacing your keys, or tending to use just a single password or key for every lock (which, if ever compromised in one situation, may lead to being compromised across many others). A Password Manager can reduce such issues, as it can be capable of 'spitting out' or transfering login details at will and letting you use many different passwords (even generating and using the kinds of passwords nobody should be able to guess, or remember! ) across your many different websites, etc. But this passkey storage must itself be secure, and so should be functionally accessible perhaps only through use of a 'master passkey' or some other kind of authentication process, which may be subject to the same issues of forgetting, copying, or theft. Similarly, a central lockbox full of keys (such as those used at some car dealerships), can make handling multiple keys much easier, while introducing a single point of failure in the event that lockbox is illicitly accessed. Various forms of multi-factor authentication , plus auxiallary authentication methods for password recovery\/reset, go some way to alleviate these challenges, at the expense of further intermediary steps and hardware requirements; but the balance between ease of use and security is never quite so simple and universal.\nThe title text mentions a one-stop-shop for decentralization. The drive to make use of one-stop-shops (such as a website aggregating searches for the best insurance) and also to decentralize (in this case not relying upon any one vendor, even that single aggregator who might actually not be the best aggregator) is another self-contradiction \u2014 because a one-stop-shop is by definition centralized.\nThe comic being posted on September 26th may be a reference to Stanislav Petrov correctly rejecting the false detection of an incoming nuclear missile strike from the US on September 26th, 1983. 2052: Stanislav Petrov Day\nFor a related xkcd on security and software cycles, see 2044: Sandboxing Cycle .\n[Caption above the panel:] All software development, eventually\n[Cueball is talking, while pointing to a drawing.

Specifically, it parodies the Equal Transit Time fallacy, which states that the air flowing above the wing and the air flowing below the wing have to travel from one side of the wing to the other in equal time, so the air above the wing has to travel faster to keep up with the air below. This assumes that the air above the wing is somehow conscious of what the air below the wing is doing.  This assumption of consciousness is taken to extreme parody by the comic, suggesting that the bottom air can be frightened by skulls, that the top air is curious to see what's going on, and that air can panic. In real life, this is not the case. [ citation needed ]\nWings can produce lift , [1] i.e. an upwards force with which an aircraft is held in the air. One or more of three main reasons may typically be given as to why airplane wings produce lift:\nThe comic references all three of these reasons. Airflow splitting references Bernoulli's principle, while the air at the bottom being scared and fleeing downwards is similar to the effect of air hitting the angled bottom of the wing. The air going over the top curving down references the Coand\u0103 effect, although the comic claims that this effect is instead caused by the top-air noticing the bottom-air fleeing downward and goes down to investigate why the bottom-air is fleeing. The mention of Newton's third law is indeed correct, even if the movement of the air is for the wrong reasons. In the title text, it additionally suggests that the top-flow also end up glimpsing the printed skulls, causing it to also chaotically flee, generating a wing's classic turbulent wake.\nRandall previously dealt with explanations of wing lift in 803: Airfoil .\n[Caption at the top of the panel above the drawing:] How a wing produces lift\n[The drawing is a diagram of the cross-section of a plane wing.

You hit your weekly goal for \"total length of your path through space if you minimize its length by pulling it taut, maneuvering it around solid objects but not through them.\"\n[Caption below the panel:] I'm into the quantified self, but only for really arbitrary quantities.\n","explanation":"Cueball embraces the quantified self , a popular philosophy promoting monitoring yourself with devices and data in the hope of helping your well-being. He does so in a unique and absurdly humorous way, with help from a smart watch or handheld mobile device. Randall 's caption indicates he is interested in the quantified self for unusual quantities.\nTypically, fitness apps and wearable devices will track the number of steps that users take and distances walked or run, along with other measurements such as heart rate, blood oxygenation level, blood pressure, and mood. This is to encourage users to be more physically active.  However, Cueball has chosen to track a modified version of this metric, in which his path is post-processed by contracting it as much as possible without it passing through anything solid. Ordinarily, people begin and end their days in bed; in this case, it can get 'caught' where Cueball has passed through topological tunnels. (See 2658: Coffee Cup Holes and 2625: Field Topology for details.) In the comic strip, we see that, over the course of his week, Cueball has looped through his house thrice and crossed under two highway overpasses, a highway sign, and apparently the St. Louis Gateway Arch before almost returning home.\nThis comic appeared two days after Google's announcement that Maps Directions will be sortable by sustainability, along with their support of self-quantification for sustainability when shopping for automobiles, used goods, and food. [1] This is noteworthy because of tech industry discussions between employees and executives comparing sharply increased profits and productivity from work-from-home to the value of coastal region commercial office space holdings and leases, relative to scope 3 emissions . [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]\nAn \"imaginary thread\" connecting a person to where they came from (as portrayed in this comic, distinct from a mystical silver cord or red thread of fate ) has been attested to by people experiencing obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD.) [8] [9] See also 100: Family Circus and below for further elaboration.\nThe title text mentions several things that would make the red path longer: passing one way through a tube such as a water slide; a tunnel, such as a subway or car wash; riding on a ferris wheel, or entering a building through one door and exiting another. In all cases the imaginary string would be \"captured\" and make the total distance longer.\nThe quantity Cueball measures can be recognized as a specific type of OCD where people feel like they have an imaginary string connecting them to where they come from. [ actual citation needed ] This is similar to describing 4-D paths in Minkowski space relative to the observer's frame of reference.\nAs they move around, that string gets entangled and they feel the urge to untangle it.  When they enter a car, they feel the need to exit the car from the same door, to avoid that the string gets trapped by forever passing through the car.  When they enter a building, they feel they need to exit using the same staircases and doorway(s), to avoid entangling the string in the building. Some situations, like turning around a lamp post, are OK because you can imagine removing the loop over the top of the lamp post, such that it is not really entangled.\nCueball tries a new approach to deal with this OCD by integrating it in his quantified self.  He defines precisely how to measure the length of the imaginary string, reduced to its minimum, and chooses this as a quantity to monitor. Unlike most people with this OCD, who feel the urge to minimize the length, Cueball takes the opposite stance trying to maximize the (optimally minimal) length of the string. By defining as a target to achieve a given length every day, he creates a drive to embrace situations that entangle the string.  This drive opposes the natural compulsion to avoid them and hopefully cancels it.  The joke of the title text is that Cueball now becomes overly interested in all the things that are disturbing for people with the OCD.\n[A red path links two red Cueballs.

In this comic, instead of charging his phone every day for a few years and then buying a new phone, Cueball has obtained a phone with a battery big enough to last supposedly until the phone will be replaced after a few years. This appears to make for a phone of cumbersome weight and size. According to the caption, 10% of battery life corresponds to 1\u20132 months; this suggests a total battery life and hence product life of 10\u201320 months, which is less than two years. A 'few' is generally more than that , even in the world of xkcd . (This assumes that he'd be 'good' right up until 0%. He could be just talking about being generally unconcerned until it reaches 5%, say, from which point he knows he'll have a similar further amount of time to start seriously thinking about arranging the full replacement, and all that this entails.) More practically, a smartphone requires around 2 kWh per year (assuming this is not otherwise an untypical phone in terms of power requirements), so this 12 kWh battery could have been expected to last even longer.\nA 12 kWh battery weighing 100 pounds (45 kg) has an energy density of 264.6 Wh\/kg, about equal to the high-estimate of the energy density of lithium-ion batteries of 100\u2013265 Wh\/kg. However, it is well below the practically achievable energy densities of (non-rechargeable, as befits the application) zinc-air batteries at around 400 Wh\/kg. Unfortunately, Self-discharge means that if this battery is lithium polymer, it will lose on average 5% of its charge per month, which totals to 46% lost each year. If this were a non rechargeable battery such a lithium metal, its battery life could be much longer.\nThis comic appeared on the same day that the European Union standardized charging adapters for mobile phones.\nThis may be a commentary on very large external portable charging devices. At present (October, 2022) the largest cell-phone sized charging devices hold almost 40000mAh and can weigh almost a pound . Even larger devices are available weighing over 40 lbs in different form factors. We buy cell phones because of their small size and convenience, [ citation needed ] and end up buying extra external battery power for them that adds significant extra weight and bulk.\nPortable (on wheels) 12 kWh lithium-ion batteries do exist but typically weigh over 250 lbs and tend to lack ports to plug a phone directly into. Roughly 100 lb portable power stations can have capacities as high as 6 kWh and can be used to charge a typical smartphone directly hundreds of times.\n[Cueball is seen carrying a large box.

She is resting one hand on the bucket and holding a crown in other other hand, which she has pulled partially up over the top of the water filled bucket. The water is now splashing over the edge of the bucket and dripping from the still partially immersed crown. Behind her back, with his back toward hers, Archimedes sits on a chair at a desk. He is depicted as a balding man with a white beard, and he is writing on a piece of paper, while a stack of papers lies in front of him.] Megan: Uh, Archimedes, why is there a bucket of water with a gold crown hidden in the bottom? Archimedes: It's mostly silver. Replica of the King's crown. He's coming here later, and I have a plan.\n[Caption beneath the panel:] Archimedes invents the heist.\n","explanation":"Archimedes was foundational mathematician and scientist who lived in the 3rd century BCE.  It was recorded that he was tasked by his tyrant king, Hiero II of Syracuse , with determining whether a votive crown made by a local goldsmith actually contained all the gold the king had provided for it, or whether the goldsmith had substituted an equal weight of silver for the more-valuable gold. Archimedes knew he could solve this problem if only he could compare the crown's weight to its volume; since any silver in it, being only about half as dense, would occupy more volume than the gold. Despite knowing this, Archimedes didn't know how to measure the volume of the crown, which was highly irregularly shaped. According to legend, as Archimedes was getting into a bath one day, the bath overflowed. Archimedes realized that the volume of water displaced by any immersed object, including his body and the crown, was equal to the submerged volume of the object, and thus he could establish the crown's volume; a crown made with substituted silver of equal mass would displace more water than the supposed gold version would. This insight led him to solve the king's problem (and determine that the goldsmith had in fact cheated the king out of some gold). Legend also says [1] that upon having this insight, he went running naked down the streets of Syracuse shouting \" eureka !\", Greek for \"I have found it!\" - a word now associated with sudden insights.\nIn the comic, Archimedes' insight doesn't involve science, but is a plan for self-enrichment. Evidently, he has concealed a less-valuable gold-plated or gold-alloy crown in the tub of liquid, and plans to swap it for the real crown when 'measuring the volume'. This implies that the king's crown turns out to be, in fact, pure gold, but Archimedes will report it to be adulterated with silver, in order to steal the gold crown for himself. This is claimed to be the invention of the heist. While theft has no doubt existed since property has existed, a \"heist\" implies a complex plan, often based on deception and carefully planned operations, as is typical of heist films .\nThe title of the comic, \" Archimedes Principle \", refers to a different but related insight of Archimedes, that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces. It may also relate to the particular twist of morality being observed by this version of Archimedes, in that it seems not to be against his principles to defraud a king, and (incidentally?) besmirch a particular master-craftsman.\nAccording to the title text, Archimedes's eureka moment wasn't when he discovered how to measure the crown's volume, but when he realized that he could use this discovery as a pretext for running naked through town, something he'd always wanted to do.\n[Megan is leaning over a large bucket standing on the floor.

Accordingly three of the problems listed are effectively as difficult as one would expect, and the remaining six are not.

Here Cueball annoys Megan , a Scientist, by referring to the hypotheses that there are subsurface oceans on some of Jupiter's Moons, as \"fan theories\".\nA fan theory is an unofficial hypothesis about a fictional work from enthusiasts instead of the official authors. Fan theories may include non-canonical background information for, or continuations of, official narratives.  Since humanity is not the \"author\" of the universe, all thoughts and writings on the nature of the universe are, almost by definition, non-canonical fan ideas.\nIn this comic, Cueball refers to scientific hypotheses as \"fan theories.\" Scientists might consider this as undervaluing their work, because scientific hypotheses are usually the result of much more serious research than the authorship of fiction. Charismatic cranks often obtain undeserved recognition for supposedly scientific hypotheses, so being lumped in with charlatans or pseudoscientists could be perceived as insensitive to rigorous scientists. Once again, Randall has attempted to devise a new way to annoy scientists. However, many if not most professional scientists are aware of similarities between hypotheses pertaining to fiction and non-fiction.\nBy referring to rigorous scientific studies as \"fan theories\" Randall is also elevating the experience of fandom. Though they are typically not supported by research institutions, tenured faculty positions, or grant funding, fandom communities often demonstrate a high degree of skill in literary criticism including evidence gathering, philosophical interpretation, and generative writing. This continues the trend of building connections between disciplines in STEM, social science, and the humanities.\nThis comic appeared a few days after renewed suggestions that life may exist within one of Saturn's moons .\nThe title text may be facetious, having to do with unwelcoming or inconsiderate fandoms (or scientists who are annoyed at being called \"fans of the universe\"), or it could be sincere .\n[Ponytail, Cueball, White Hat, and Megan standing in a line.

The first of these may be from 1965 [1] .\nThe first 4 images are common, real-life comparisons involving people walking, people on bicycles, public transport, and cars, which distinctly show how cars take up significantly more space for the same number of people than the other methods of transport. However, from this point the comic becomes more and more absurd in its comparisons.\nThe initial bicycles and singular bus are actually (mostly) using the left-hand lane of the three shown, for whatever reason. This would not be unusual on British highways or other countries using their system, whether the lanes seen are just one of the directional carriageways of a multi-lane split highway or the centre-lane is a gantry-signed 'tidal lane' of a fully two-way street. Yet people who have to walk on a road (due to no footway) are advised to walk facing oncoming traffic (the right-hand side, in the same jurisdiction) and not bunched up. It would be interesting to know why Randall, much more familiar with US road conventions, would have offset these various road-users the way he did (rather than hogging the central lane, or across the entire highway width as he did with the other diagrams in the series).\nThe title text proposes a problem related to another alternative form of transport \u2014 the electric scooter. Randall wonders how well an electric scooter would function when run inside the hamster ball. While this could function like a spherical monowheel , it might also be very dangerous.\n[Overhead views of ten segments of highway in two rows with a caption above.

Partial solar eclipses are fairly frequent (2\u20135 per year), but total eclipses are less frequent (about every 18 months), and most of them will not be in convenient locations for a particular set of people. Cueball seems to be talking about total eclipses visible in much of North America: April 8, 2024 and August 12, 2045 . (There's also an annular eclipse on October 14, 2023.) Making plans for eclipses is awkward given the uncertainty present for anything else far in the future, such as whether the attendees will have children by then, and whether the technology they are using to keep track of their appointments (Google Calendar in this case) will even still exist over 22 years in the future.\nBlack Hat claims he can't make it, as he vaguely and obscurely claims he already knows he has \"a thing\" on August 12, 2045. People do not usually have events scheduled for precise dates that far in the future in their personal calendars and, combined with the fact that Black Hat remembers this date without checking (but also without specifying what he'll be doing then), implies that this could be another of his grand and sinister plans... or he just doesn't want to go.  This might also be a reference to an old Soviet joke .\nThe title text is someone asking to reschedule a medical appointment to see the eclipse. The eclipse is hard to move because that would require hastening or delaying it by moving the Earth, Moon or Sun, any of which would require vast amounts of energy.

Captain: Let's see what kind of budget these showrunners have.\n[Caption below the panel:] If I ever find myself in a space adventure, I'll assume I'm a fictional character and try to probe the studio's financial constraints.\n","explanation":"This comic references space adventure television series and appear to show a typical scene from such a series: The trope of the vessel (in this case a relatively powerless shuttlecraft modeled after the Star Trek Original Series shuttle Galileo ) evading combat with some unseen but presumably more battleworthy enemy vessel by fleeing into some form of 'space geography' that the heroes think, or hope, they can hide in or fly through more successfully than their pursuers can find or follow them in. Oftentimes a negative space wedgie ( Deus ex machina ) or some nebulous form of canyon-run , but if it is an actual black hole (within which the use of fantastical physics is intended to provide some sort of uncertain plot-armour) then often it's a swirly-effect meant to appear to be some kind of cosmic plughole. And this is the escape-route (or hiding place) that this particular ship seems about to try to take advantage of.\nThe command to head towards the black hole normally promises some (fictional) manner of breaking physics to survive the phenomenon, but is instead followed up by a command that seems intent to break the Fourth Wall . i.e. assuming that this is a fictional scenario and intending to establish exactly what kind of fictional scenario it is. By attempting to interact with the black hole in the most computationally intensive way possible (firing all kinds of weaponry at it, in distinctly different ways) they 'aim' to find out how thoroughly accurate their fictional existence actually is, potentially to test the in-universe physics and find out with which method their in the real world unsurvivable situation might be escaped from.\n(We can aleady see that it is the imagery of a black hole (or, rather, the hot matter still visible as swirling around its event horizon) featured in the film Interstellar , a high-budget blockbuster which famously created this particular effect from the calculations of actual professional physicists. Although Randall has also used the actual imagery of a black hole , elsewhere.)\nExactly how this helps the crew and passengers, is unclear, but being genre-aware ( or not ) can have implications for how characters manage to handle the problems that crop up in their various plotlines. The title text indicates that the resulting effects \"looked cool\", which may not necessarily indicate particular accuracy to 'real life' but indicates at least that the showrunners are taking this fiction seriously . It leads on to the assumption that there is one key piece of information , that one of those present possesses, which has some bearing on their current predicament. And they are going to be in peril from all kinds of 'monsters of the week' or other nemeses at least until they learn what that is, so perhaps they could skip much of the danger just by a more immediate revelation.\n\u201cPrestige TV\u201d is another name for the present Golden Age of Television , which started around the year 2000. Golden Age television shows are more likely to have better special effects (more high-quality post-processed Computer-generated imagery (CGI) , rather than 'green screen' background replacement or even a purely practical effect such as 'suitmation' or other modelling ) which contrast greatly with the effects of earlier eras. The ability to show weapons being fired, and even some more intuitive-looking emulation of physics, has improved as the production technologies have improved, and potentially made sufficiently good-looking special effects cheaper \u2014 certainly more ubiquitous. This then may be considered a co-indicator towards the tendency of newer and more 'cool' looking shows to also develop complex interwoven season-long (or even whole-series) story arcs, which build upon multiple cliff-hangers and situational developments for the characters involved. This is as a contrast to the more traditional stand alone episodes of drama, from earlier decades, that almost always resolve in precisely the conclusive manner that leaves the characters mostly in the same frame of mind as in the start \u2013 such that they arrive fresh in the next episode, or indeed any further episode, under virtually the same pretextual scenario.\nThe other portion of the title text seems to refer to a relatively common trope of internal conflict being somehow related to external conflict, and the increasingly common trope of having a character with a *mysterious past* they've conveniently forgotten slowly rediscover, and grapple with, who they were, the culmination of that character arc often setting up the group of protagonists to be able to defeat the Big Bad Evil Guy ( BBEG ) or somehow escape the situation they're in.\n[Against a black background, a white spaceship travels toward a space object, identified as a black hole.

See below for more.\nThis comic pokes fun at some of the ways to write the division operation in math. In this comic, Randall has used A as the dividend (the number being divided) and B as the divisor (the number that A is divided by). Division is the fourth simplest arithmetic operation in mathematics, after addition, subtraction, and multiplication. [1]\nThe first two of the seven notations shown are the division sign (\u00f7) and the long division notation used for short division and long division in beginning arithmetic. (Note: division typography is only used in some countries, and there are different notations in the non-English speaking world ). These methods of division are often used by school children because the \u00f7 sign is what most people use when first learning division, and the short division format is usually the first algorithm learned for dividing arbitrary dividends, typically starting with the easier abbreviated short division form.\nThe expression on the third line, A\/B, is the way division is usually written in software code. The four simple arithmetic operations in programming usually are +, -, *, \/. This line was not in the first version of the comic. This is most commonly seen in regular mathematics as it somewhat saves space, and is easy to type with the slash key. Additionally, it uses standard ASCII characters instead of sophisticated notation. A notable exception is APL , which uses an idiosyncratic character set modeled after traditional arithmetic.\nThe expression on the fourth line, A \/ B , is how division is usually written by hand [ actual citation needed ] . It is nearly identical to the fraction notation that follows, but the diagonal line allows each number to be bigger while still fitting into a single line of text. The third line's representation is the best approximation of this line's notation on a computer, without using more obscure Unicode characters. The Unicode character set can be used to accurately represent division as on the fourth line in plain text, using a small set of precomposed fractions (\u2154, \u2155, etc.), regular numerals and U+2044 FRACTION SLASH (e.g. 22\u20447, provided font support exists), or superscript and subscript numerals (e.g. \u00b2\u00b2\/\u2087, or \u00b2\u00b2\u2044\u2087 with the fraction slash). Using any of these requires a greater knowledge of Unicode, and the know-how (and, possibly, patience) to type them, so it is likely that only a Unicode enthusiast would type division like this. You could also use HTML, like this: 22 \/ 7 .\nThe sixth, \"fancy,\" notation uses a negative exponent. The exponent -1 is equivalent to reciprocation . It can be used to keep an entire division expression on one line. Note that AB -1 is equal to A \/ B only if A and B are in a commutative ring (and B has an inverse). If A and B are, for example, matrices, AB -1 is not the same in general as B -1 A (and the notation A \/ B is never used in this case as it would be ambiguous). The AB -1 format is also often used to express physical units.\nThe final form of notation declares a function. The writer defines a new function, F, that takes in the parameters A and B, before listing out the function's definition (trailing off in increasingly smaller text). Defining things as functions is very normal for mathematics, but likely not very efficient at all to commonly do for the simple operation of division.  Occasionally a highly formalized definition such as this could be a setup for an elaborate and extensive proof, hence Randall warns the reader they should escape while they still can. Integer division can be defined in terms of multiplicative inequalities and the remainder, or modulo ('%' in most programming languages) operator. This situation is likely to occur in many sorts of algebra, where one might have to define what \"division\" means for two elements of a mathematical object such as a group, ring, or magma. One example would be an object G, such that, for two elements A and B of G, \"A divided by B\" is defined as an element C such that CB=A, or alternatively as an element C such that BC=A. These definitions will differ if multiplication in G is not commutative. Furthermore, if such a C is not unique, the function F(A,B) will need to include a method to select a unique value for \"A divided by B\" for each A and B. Thus, the F(A,B) in the comic might not even refer to a uniquely defined operation, but simply to the property of a function F(A,B) that is a valid division operation on G, given some definition of division. You were warned.\nThe title text is a Science Tip . It discusses how the division sign (\u00f7) has fallen out of favor in most professional contexts (the ISO-80000 guidelines even specify the symbol \"should not be used\") yet has resisted all efforts to repurpose it as a new function. Specifically, it pokes fun at how similar the division sign is to a percent sign (%). A scientist might be really mad at the use of the division sign as an alternative to a percent sign because it is the wrong symbol in that context, ever though they never use it for the original meaning any more. The use of \u00f7 instead of\u00a0% is something that may appear on signs for discount offers.\n[The transcript has both formatted text for visuals and a description at the start of the line.] [Underlined text:] Division notation\n[A [Division sign] B is above, B [Long division symbol] A is below.

A similar view is in the \" turtles all the way down \" view of the universe, but here the universe is suspended in bubbles, and those bubbles suspended in a universe suspended in bubbles, \"all the way down\" (or at least one layer down).\nThe title text claims this theory \"Finally unifies cosmic inflation and regular inflation.\" Cosmic inflation refers to the expansionary phase of the universe shortly after the Big Bang; this would explain why that happened with the simple proposition that it was a bubble and inflated like regular bubbles do. (Ignoring various issues \u2013 like the sheer size of the universe, at least in terms of its own scale.) It also makes a pun on special and general relativity, and how they've been hard to merge for a long, long time; the result of which is known as the grand unified theory.\nThe scene looks like it could be part of an infinite recursion.

Fermat's Last Theorem states that no three positive integers a , b , and c satisfy the equation a n + b n = c n for any integer value of n greater than 2. It is notable for having remained unproved for hundreds of years, despite many attempts to prove it; it's called his 'last' theorem because it was the last one left without proof or disproof. The\u00a0Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture (now known as the Modularity theorem) and the epsilon conjecture (now known as Ribet's theorem) together imply that Fermat's Last Theorem is true. The\u00a0epsilon conjecture, proposed by\u00a0Jean-Pierre Serre, became provable thanks to\u00a0Ken Ribet in 1986. Andrew Wiles , with assistance from his former student Richard Taylor , succeeded in proving a special case of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for semistable elliptical curves in 1995, which finally established the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. (The full Modularity theorem was subsequently established as correct by Wiles's former students\u00a0Brian Conrad,\u00a0Fred Diamond\u00a0and\u00a0Richard Taylor, and\u00a0Christophe Breuil in 2001.)\nThe young Fermat here didn't try to prove the mathematical equation, but simply tried to read it as words, treating the \"+\" sign as a \"t\" so that \"A N +\" can be read as \"ANT\". His interpretation was quickly disproved because there's no \"A\" between \"B\" and \"C\", and no \"O\" between \"C\" and \"N\".  It's unclear if this is considered Fermat's First Theorem because it was the first he made, or because it was the first to be conclusively disproved.\nIn the title text, the \"words\" are \"ANT BNECN\", treating the equals sign \"=\" as an \"E\"; while \"=\" doesn't look especially close to \"E\", it is similar in that it contains horizontal bars in a horizontally symmetrical arrangement (and of course, it can be read as \"equals\", which begins with \"E\"). If the letter E is written in sans-serif block text in white on a black background, the \"negative space\" between the Upper Bar, the Middle Bar and the Lower Bar of the E form a =. The comic shows a blackboard with white letters. The text then references Wiles, asserting that he proved this modified form of Fermat's First Theorem as well by cooking this \"ant bnecn\" (whatever \"bnecn\" is) as breakfast.\n2492: Commonly Mispronounced Equations also contains equations pronounced as if they were words in the ordinary sense.\n[A Hairy-like boy, representing Pierre de Fermat as a child, stands at a blackboard holding a piece of chalk.

It is a popular doodle among teenagers and pre-teens as it can be quickly hashed out using six vertical lines which are then connected with an appropriate pattern of diagonal lines. The drawing has been around for a very long time, and may be independently discovered simply because it is a logical progression of combining a series of straight lines in an interesting manner.\nRandall first draws the steps to make the Cool S. Then he draws a chain of repeats of this pattern, excluding the end caps, making something that looks like a twisted rope. Finally he separates the two strands and adds cross bars, creating something that turns out to have a visual similarity to the discovered helical structure of DNA .  However, although the final diagram is a double helix, the chirality, or \"handedness\", is backwards: an actual DNA molecule usually winds in the opposite direction (clockwise, if you're looking at it end-on). (The tutorial at How to (correctly) draw DNA describes this in more detail.) It is possible for left-handed DNA segments, called Z-DNA, to form in purine-pyrimidine alternating regions; but this is much less common than the more typical conformations of B-DNA and A-DNA. (B-DNA is the most common and is elongated with accentuated major grooves: see Nucleic acid structure . This asymmetry can be seen in the spacing between strand segments, which alternates between short and long distances, as opposed to A-DNA and Z-DNA where these distances are much more uniform.)\nHe posits that the helical shape of DNA was originally discovered when somebody decided to doodle this extended S pattern.\nUnderstanding the shape of the DNA molecule was an important step towards understanding how it duplicates itself and serves as a template for RNA. In real life, Francis Crick and James Watson were awarded a Nobel Prize for this discovery.\nThe title text is a reference to Rosalind Franklin , who made a material contribution to the discovery of DNA but was controversially not included in the Nobel Prize . Many are quick to assume she was excluded simply due to sexism, although she had also been dead for five years and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously, regardless of the nature of the contribution. Franklin's boss at the time of the discovery, Maurice Wilkins , was also named on the prize. Wilkins had shared some of Franklin's data with Watson, who then shared what he saw with Crick. None of the three men ever told Franklin that Watson and Crick had based their model on her data.\nThis account is reminiscent of how August Kekul\u00e9 said he identified the ring structure of the benzene molecule. He claimed to have had a dream in which the atoms were moving around, with the last grabbing onto the first like the classic image of a snake grabbing its tail, forming a ring of six lines.\n[10 drawings evolving from simple dashes, to a \"cool S\" symbol, to a representation of DNA.

Cueball claims to have created a texting app that only allows for this one thing. It does not, however, allow \"Bob\" to reply, making the usefulness of the app questionable at best. It is unclear how it enforces the name restriction, but it is possible that the app figures out the name of the phone's owner. The title text mentions Eve, who in the typical story represents an \"eavesdropper\", someone who attempts to intercept the messages between Alice and Bob.  The fact that persons named Eve are 'forbidden' from installing the app suggests that it might not actually be as secure as Cueball advertises -- it may be that he naively thinks that it's just the name that makes the eavesdropper, and that by excluding all Eves, Alice's messages to Bob will remain private. It is not clear which phones will support this app, but it appears to be perfectly suited for the xkcd Phones .\nNote also that Eve being forbidden to install the app parallels another Eve being forbidden to eat an apple (an app-le?) in a common retelling of the Biblical story of the Garden of Eden (though the actual Biblical text doesn't refer to an apple).  Spoiler alert: The Biblical Eve ate the forbidden fruit anyway, and this Eve is probably going to install the app anyway...\nThe comics 177: Alice and Bob and 1323: Protocol are also about Alice and Bob.\nEven if the assumption that you could divine people's roles and motives from their names were correct, if the names of the users don't need to be verified, it seems possible for a bad actor to circumvent the security features of the app by simply lying about their name. Genuine users could also undermine the security with double installations and a complete mess of a contact list in which everyone's names are somehow identified as \"Alice\" or \"Bob\", in order to increase its utility to them. Also, it would appear that \"Bob\" needn't be the commonly used name of the message receiver, in this scenario \u2013 it could also be a diminutive of what he is actually known by. Thus a user might claim to be \"Bob\" whichever his given name is.\nThis may be related to the announcement that Signal would be discontinuing support for SMS\/MMS messages.\n[Cueball showing a phone to a long-haired woman, identified in the caption as Alice] Cueball: The app will let you send messages to your friend Robert, or my brother.

Cueball: Hey, don\u2019t touch Chekhov\u2019s gun!\n[Caption below panel:] My home decorating theme is \"ominous metaphorical objects.\"\n","explanation":"The sword of Damocles , Siege Perilous , Chekhov's gun , and Pandora's box are mythical or conceptual objects associated with impending threats. These names are now used metaphorically for complex concepts related to danger.  Cueball seems to have either taken inspiration from these tales and named some objects after them or (possibly with Beret Guy 's help) managed to obtain the genuine items, using them as decorations in his house.\nThe Sword of Damocles refers to a lost history of Sicily, in which Damocles was said to be an obsequious courtier who envied the king's power and luxury. The king offered to let Damocles serve as king for a day, but during that day, arranged for a sword to be hung above the throne, suspended by a single hair.  This was to teach Damocles the lesson that, along with the privileges of being king, there was also perpetual and inescapable danger and anxiety. The term has passed into general use for any situation that involves an ever-present threat of harm.\nThe Siege Perilous, in Arthurian legend , is a seat at the Round Table, reserved by Merlin for the knight destined to retrieve the Holy Grail.  It was said to be fatal to any unworthy person who sat in it. The term is used as a metaphor for any situation that's exceptionally dangerous to anyone not fully prepared.\nChekhov's Gun is a writing principle highlighting the importance of conservation of detail. The term originates from playwright Anton Chekhov, who repeatedly used the example of an unfired gun to advocate removing superfluous elements from a narrative.  In one such case, he said \"If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there.\" (It should be noted that, like most artistic rules, experienced writers will deliberately violate this advice when appropriate, especially to creatively misdirect similarly experienced audiences.) Cueball might not want Megan touching it because doing so means it will be fired shortly afterwards, following through its core concept.\nPandora's Box is a tale from Greek Mythology. According to myth, Pandora was the first woman, created by Hephaestus, and was given a jar (later translated as \"box\") and told never to open it. Eventually she did, and unleashed all the miseries into the world. The term has come to represent any situation where a small but ill-considered action results in numerous, often intractable, problems.\nGiven that two of the objects are potential hazards (the sword and the gun) and the third explicitly fatal, it is quite apt that they would come in such a box.\n[Cueball and Megan stand in a room. At one wall a sword hangs by a thread above a chair. On another wall a rifle is fastened to a board with illegible writing. Megan has one arm stretched towards the rifle.] Cueball: Yeah, I think the sword of Damocles looks nice hanging over the Siege Perilous.

The second panel shows a list of different contexts for this conversation, ranking them from \"Fine\" to \"Very Bad\".\nThe title text references epistemology , a branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of knowledge and truth, for which Randall says Wirecutter' s recommendations are great.

[2] The problem was whether a path through the city crossing each of the seven bridges just once exists, without crossing the river forks any other way. In 1736, Euler proved that no such path exists. This result is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory and the first proof in the theory of networks [3] \u2014 a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics \u2014 and presaged the development of topology . Combinatorial problems of other types had been considered since antiquity. Graphs are a data structure common in many algorithmic problems in computer science.\nCueball attempts to cheat on the final exam in his algorithms class by traveling back in time to commission the construction of an eighth bridge before Euler could learn of the problem, allowing a trivial solution that would remove the rationale for further analysis. He hopes that this would alter his present-day timeline in such a way that the test becomes easier because graph theory might never have been developed. The use of the word \"tried\" implies failure, which is probably a good thing since his success would create a paradox . Time travel is a recurring topic on xkcd and examples where attempts to change the past fails has also been used before like in 1063: Kill Hitler .\nWith the addition of the eighth bridge, it becomes possible to cross each bridge exactly once, starting at the north bank and ending on the larger eastern island, or vice-versa. However, there is still no way to traverse each bridge exactly once and return to the starting point, because the altered graph would have an Euler trail but not an Euler cycle. Thus the problem might still have been interesting to Euler. [ citation needed ] (Adding a ninth bridge connecting the north bank to the east island would render the problem completely trivial.) We can't say whether Euler or others would have developed graph theory anyway, or whether Cueball's exam would have been any easier or more difficult.\nAn alternative modification allowing an easy solution is to remove bridges. During World War II, two bridges to the central island connecting it to the north and south banks were destroyed by bombing, so today there is an Eulerian trail across the five remaining bridges.\nThe title text alludes to the fact that ordinary aluminum foil , which was not commercially available until 1911, would have been a tremendously valuable curiosity in the 18th century, which didn't even have tin foil . Aluminum was a highly priced metal before the 1880s when inexpensive methods were developed to refine it. The Washington Monument was constructed with a tip made of pure aluminum due to its value and conductive capacity (this turned out to be a bad idea, because it attracted lightning, which melted some of the aluminum). Aluminum had not been extracted in its pure form at the time of Euler, and was known only in compounds such as alum , so the metal would have been unique and exotic. The value of aluminum and the use of it as the tip of the Washington Monument was also mentioned in 1608: Hoverboard where a heist to steal the tip is depicted .\n[Cueball, standing next to two men wearing wigs, pointing with a pointer at a map showing the seven bridges problem, with an extra bridge added in dashed lines] Cueball: Lord Mayor of K\u00f6nigsberg, I will reward you handsomely if you construct this bridge before my friend Leonhard arrives.\n[Caption below the panel:] I tried to use a time machine to cheat on my algorithms final by preventing graph theory from being invented.\n"}

In reality, volcanoes are caused by the pressure of magma (underground lava) from below the Earth's crust pushing up through it, not seeds. [ citation needed ]\nVolcanic soil is generally fertile and replenishes depleted elements in the soil, just like commercial fertilizers. However, the process of eruption is destructive to whatever plants are presently in the garden, as Cueball points out. Beret Guy's announcement in the final panel resembles the voice-over from a nature documentary.\nIn the first panel, Beret Guy states that he made these seeds himself, presumably using his proven skill at exotic bioengineering . It is unclear whether his volcano is capable of self-propagating but, until his 'help' with maintaining the garden, there would probably be no particular risk of volcanic activity.\nThe title text alludes to the fact that sulfate aerosols from volcanic eruptions may cause a short-term cooling effect because the aerosols in the atmosphere block out energy from the sun. This expands on the comedy from a small scale volcano by adding small scale volcano effects. Realistically a small supply of aerosols would be blown away and dispersed by wind. Not to mention the fact that, of course, the currently flowing lava is potentially harmful to all plants near the garden anyway.\n[Cueball is standing, holding a trowel, in a vague outdoor area.

Accuracy and precision are common concepts to be encountered in the scientific field and often students have issues with the differences between them. Accuracy concerns whether a statement is true, while precision concerns how detailed it is; it is possible for a statement to be one but not the other. The comic explores this concept by comparing Barack Obama , former President of the United States, with cats . Confusingly, he measures different statistics of both Barack Obama and cats (sometimes measuring them in terms of cats) leaving the unwary reader even more confused.\nBeing precise is typical of calculations that roll out an excess of significant digits, often in the form of trailing decimals. Precision is lowered by using more rounded figures, or merely being comparative, but largely unaffected by whether the original values used were accurate or even correct. Accuracy is a cumulative function of the accuracy given to the intermediate values used for any calculation, and can be degraded by using figures that are themselves in some way inaccurate or imprecise. One part of confusion between the two is because being too precise usually decreases accuracy.\nThe numbers mentioned in the top row (high precision) of the table all use exactly the same digits, dictating that a full five digits of precision are used in them all. The most \"valid\" or correct value is a number that's very accurate and precise (see table). For the medium accuracy the number is an anagram of the 1st entry, giving a value that is reasonable but would be overly exact, whilst the low accuracy number is just a repeat of the first entry's digits with a shifted decimal but clearly at the wrong scale, as Randall could have shifted the decimal point one further place to the left to be closest to the true measurement. Instead, he replaces the thousands separator with the decimal point, perhaps for the visual pun.\nThe title text compares Obama's and cats' enjoyment of playing with cardboard boxes. While cats are known to do this, [ citation needed ] we don't know whether Obama does.\nThe day prior to the publication of this comic (November 8, 2022) was election day in the United States, so Randall may have been remembering Barack Obama's presidency at this time.\n[The comic shows a table with 3 rows and 3 columns.

A triangular arrowhead labeled \"Now\" is also above indicating a rough position most of the way through the section that would represent the year 2022.]\n[Caption:] Reminder: By now you should have finished your Y2K recovery and be several years into 2038 preparation.\n","explanation":"The Y2K bug, or more formally, the year 2000 problem , was the computer errors caused by two digit software representations of calendar years incorrectly handling the year 2000, such as by treating it as 1900 or 19100. The year 2038 problem is a similar issue with timestamps in Unix time format, which will overflow their signed 32-bit binary representation on January 19, 2038.\nWhile initial estimates were that the Y2K problem would require about half a trillion dollars to address, there was widespread recognition of its potential severity several years in advance. Concerted efforts among organizations including computer and software manufacturers and their corporate and government users reflected unprecedented cooperation, testing, and enhancement of affected systems costing substantially less than the early estimates. On New Year's Day 2000, few major errors actually occurred. Those that did usually did not disrupt essential processes or cause serious problems, and the few of them that did were usually addressed in days to weeks. The software code reviews involved allowed correcting other errors and providing various enhancements which often made up at least in part for the the cost of correcting the date bug.\nIt is unclear whether the 2038 problem will be addressed as effectively in time, but documented experience with the Y2K bug and increased software modularity and access to source code has allowed many otherwise vulnerable systems to already upgrade to wider timestamp and date formats, so there is reason to believe that it may be even less consequential and expensive. The 2038 problem has been previously mentioned in 607: 2038 and 887: Future Timeline .\nThis comic assumes that the 38 years between Y2K and Y2038 should be split evenly between recovering from Y2K and preparing for Y2038. That would put the split point in 2019. The caption points out that it's now, in 2022, well past that demarcation line, so everyone should have completed their \"Y2K recovery\" and begun preparing for year 2038. It is highly unlikely that there are more than a very few consequential older systems that still suffer from the Y2K bug, as systems built to operate this millennium handle years after 1999 correctly. The topic of whether or not Y2K was actually as big of a problem as it was made out to be remains hotly debated. The main arguments falling into the general camps of \"nothing bad happened, Y2K would have overwhelmingly been an inconvenience rather than a problem\" vs. \"very little happened only because of the massive effort put into prevention\". It is unlikely that there will ever be a conclusive answer to the question, with the truth probably being somewhere in between those two extremes. Whatever the answer to that question may be, the reaction to Y2K did result in a significant push towards, and raise in public awareness of, clean and futureproofed code.\nThe title text refers to replacing the 32-bit signed Unix time format with a hypothetical new 33-bit signed integer time and date format, which is very unlikely as almost all contemporary computer data structure formats are allocated no more finely than in 8-bit bytes. Doing this may seem complicated to new software developers, but recompiling with a larger size of integers was a normal solution for the Y2K bug among engineers of Randall 's generation, who learned to code when computer memory space was still at a premium. Taking 20 years to develop and implement such a format is not entirely counterproductive, as it would add another 68 years of capability, but it is a far less efficient use of resources than upgrading to the widely available and supported 64-bit Unix time replacement format and software compatibility libraries.\n[A timeline rectangle with 37 short dividing lines between the two ends, defining it into 38 minor sections, with the label \"2000\" above, associated with the leftmost edge, \"2038\" associated with the rightmost edge and \"2019\" directly over the centermost division that starts the section which covers that year, which is also extended to form a dotted line divided the whole height of the timeline into two equal 19-section halves.

Cueball says he won't go home with Megan because she doesn't have the mattress brand sold by their sponsor . She responds by pointing out a feature of that brand:  their same-day delivery policy. This argument could easily be a TV commercial for the mattress, though Cueball's ultimate retort suggests (whether he wants it to or not) that there still won't be a \"happy ending\" conclusion to this play-acting, either fictionally or once real life resumes.\nThe title text hints, however, that Megan was already before the date going to promote the Jumanji franchise , for her own gain. Megan's realization that she could not discuss this subject since Cueball had not seen it leads to her initial reaction starting their date to be shared, but not for the reason she had anticipated. But then when she sees they are still going viral, she is ready to use this new situation to bring in a lot of \"mattress money\". And as it turns out even when splitting with Cueball she will earn more. Since Cueball presumably came into the date with the intention of finding a romantic partner rather than gaining a sponsorship, he will probably get even less happy with Megan. Alternatively, as he plays along with her in the last frame, he sees this as an acceptable or even preferable arrangement (considering that the date wasn't going all too well in the first place).\n[Cueball and Megan are sitting at a table in a restaurant with their meals still on their plate and filled wine glasses.

Megan: Look.\n[Zoom in just on Cueball in his chair. He is holding the cellphone while he sees a video. What the video shows is shown above him in a frame. The \"video\" window shows a scene from earlier in their date. And below the picture there is a title and below that an eye with the number of followers shown. In the scene they are sitting as in the first panel, but both have their arms raised. Cueball's arms towards Megan and she has her arms above her head.

Both are typing frantically at their phones, (indicated with vibration lines on either side of their phones), using both hands, to document the date disaster live. Ponytail is to the left of them with food on her plate and a glass of water on her table and Hairy is to the right with a wine glass on his table. Cueball has raised one hand with a finger pointing up.

Each column is labeled with a service name and its logo beneath, except that for the last column, the device's longer name is written higher than all the other services' names, with an arrow pointing to a drawing of the device below it.]\n","explanation":"This comic compares different remote communication services, including the relatively well-known Twitter , Discord , Mastodon , Facebook (FB), Slack , Signal , Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Tumblr , Reddit , and SMS mobile telephone text messages. It also includes the less well-known Cybiko \u00ae wireless handheld computer for teens. For each of these, it purports to indicate which of various features they support. The comic illustrates how feature comparison charts and infographics can be abused by sellers who are trying to make their products look better than they really are, compared to their competitors. The comic may have been inspired by the recent surge in users looking for an alternative to Twitter, due to its purchase by Elon Musk , and the subsequent mass firings and resignation of its staff.\nThe Cybiko was a handheld computer designed for teens and released in 2000, which featured its own two-way radio text messaging capabilities along with built-in games and a music player. Additional information about it is available at the Dead Media Archive , as the device has not been manufactured since 2003. The chart suggests that the Cybiko has an advantage over all of the other listed communication services, as it is capable of all eight of the table's listed features, with none of the others being close.\nThe features compared are direct messaging , group chats , file transfer , built-in games ,  instances of the software run by individual users instead of the corporation producing it, lack of a central server requirement, mesh networking , and wireless message delivery without an active internet connection.\nMesh networking is a form of connectivity that reduces or removes the need for a centralized server or predefined gateways to a communications 'backbone'. Nodes communicate directly with any nodes that happen to be contactable, and from there may connect through to whatever nodes are in mutual contact, or to be found further afield, either in real-time or asynchronously. The Cybiko has this ability, as well as wireless message delivery because it communicates directly to other devices via radio, hence the ability to operate without any internet connectivity at all. There are several ongoing projects for distributed social networking , but all of these additionally require a hardware layer to provide signalling via their respective protocols. The Cybiko provides such via its decentralized radio capabilities.\nThe comic does not mention the downsides of the Cybiko, that being purchasing one, and finding friends who own one, can be its own challenge, as it was discontinued nearly 20 years ago. Additionally, the comparison can be considered apples to oranges, since Cybiko is a device rather than a service ; a fairer comparison would be to a modern smartphone , which can provide most of these features via multiple apps, including ones written especially for such rival services. Even ignoring the above, some of the Cybiko's \"advantages\" come with their own drawbacks: while not requiring a central server nor the Internet, for example, is touted as a plus, the Cybiko instead relies on having other devices in proximity to relay messages, meaning that unless the person you are sending to is nearby, it will not function. This is not an issue on any of the other options.\nThis comic contains several errors. Mastodon doesn't support file transfer. Discord does not provide for user-run instances itself, only user-moderated and administrated instances. (There are two third party Discord server implementations, but it is unclear whether those could be counted as run by users.) Slack does not provide for user-run instances itself. Reddit does not provide for user-run instances at all, only user moderation and administration. IRC does require at least one central server, [1] and relegates file transfer support to client extensions. Signal is heavily used in user-run instances via a diverse ecosystem of code forks; many of these don't require a central server, a couple use mesh networking. Reddit occasionally does have built-in games. Finally, SMS has a form of group chats, (Tumblr used to have a form of group chat, but it was removed in September of 2021 ).\nThe comic has been updated twice to fix some of these errors. The first version suggested Mastodon did not support user-run instances and required a central server, and that Reddit supported file transfer. This was changed once shortly after publication to add a check mark under \"Mastodon\" for \"User-Run Instances\". A second change was made some time later to check \"Doesn't Require Central Server\" for Mastodon and uncheck \"File Transfer\" for Reddit.\nThe title text refers to the translucent plastic covers that were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n[A table with checkmarks to indicate which features various messaging services have.

She has turned her head away from the computer looking at Cueball's screen.] Cueball: Can you help me with my account? Ponytail: Oh no.\n[Cueball holds his laptop up in front of Ponytail who has turned the chair so she faces him, with her hands in her lap. Her table is not drawn.] Cueball: No no, I promise it's a normal problem this time. Ponytail: Okay. Fine. What is it?\n[Cueball holds both hands out palm up towards Ponytail who is sitting with his laptop in her lap typing on it.] Cueball: I included a null string terminator as part of my password, and now I can't- Ponytail: How?! Cueball: They said to use special characters!\n","explanation":"Cueball asks Ponytail to help him because he can't log in to his account. Having attempted to fix Cueball's tech issues in the past, Ponytail replies with dread. Cueball promises that \"It's a normal problem this time\", and Ponytail agrees to look at it. But then Cueball reveals that he has included a null string terminator character in his password when creating an account and now he can't log in.\nIn computer systems, every \"character\" (letter, digit, punctuation, etc.) is represented as an integer. For example the lowercase letter 'a' is represented as the number 97, and the digit '1' is represented as the number 49 (when using the ASCII character encoding or Unicode character encoding). A \"string\" refers to a sequence of characters, and can be used to store arbitrary text (for example names, messages, passwords). Strings can be arbitrarily long, so some mechanism must be used to record their length. One approach is to store the length explicitly ( Pascal string ). Another approach is to mark the end of the string using a specific character, usually the null character (which is represented as the number 0); such strings are called null-terminated strings , and are used by the C programming language . Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. A limitation of null-terminated strings is that they cannot be used to represent text containing embedded null characters. This is usually not a problem, because normal text never contains null characters. However, if somehow a null character were to end up in the string, it would cause problems: any code that uses that string would assume this null character marks the end of the string, so the string would effectively be cut off.\nAccount registration systems often place requirements on passwords in an attempt to encourage users to pick stronger passwords. For example, they might ask that the password include at least one \"special character\" (such as [email\u00a0protected] #$%^&* ). Cueball misunderstood this requirement as referring to characters such as the null character (which is more accurately referred to as a control character ). Cueball managed to type the null character as part of his password somehow (on some systems it is possible to type the null character using certain keyboard shortcuts such as Ctrl + Space , Ctrl + @ , Ctrl + 2 , or Alt+0 using the number pad ), but the software running the registration system was poorly written and could not cope with this \u2013 it allowed him to create an account with that password, but then when he tried to log in with the same password the system didn't accept it.\nIt's unclear how that particular situation might arise in real software, but here is a similar situation that can easily happen in practice: Suppose a website's registration form allows the user's new password to have up to 20 characters, but due to a programmer error the login page only accepts passwords with up to 18 characters. If the user picks a medium-length password (say with 12 characters), all is well. But if the user picks a password with 20 characters, they will be able to register but they won't be able to log in (which is what happened to Cueball). Some additional situations are described below .\nThe title text describes a password which is \"just\" every Unicode character concatenated into a single string. Unicode is a standard for representing characters from many writing systems, and it has 149,186 characters [1] as at the time of this comic (with new characters being added over time). A password consisting of all of those characters would be extremely long; it would be impractical to type by hand, and would be too long for pretty much all account registration systems. (A \"codepoint\" is the number assigned to a character, and UTF-8 is a common encoding system for representing each Unicode codepoint as a sequence of bytes .) Also, since Unicode includes the null character, the password would have the same issue as Cueball's password. Further, if the account registration system treats the null character as a string terminator (as in C), then the password would be equivalent to an empty password (assuming it contains the Unicode codepoints in order, starting with the null character).\n[Cueball carries an open laptop over to Ponytail, holding in in both hands. The screen shows a box filling the screen with some text on lines. Ponytail is sitting in an office chair with her laptop at her desk.

This is a common requirement in exploratory statistics for comparing trends in a series \u2014 finding the cutoff where the slope changes may reveal valuable information about the data.\nThe comic compares two methods. Firstly, a novice method \u2014 by 'doing a bunch of statistics'- i.e, applying various statistical tools to analyze the data and figure out the quantitative change in slope. This results in two equations for the trendlines above and below a given value, a box plot, a histogram, and a line chart. It is unknown exactly what methods the novice used to figure out the change in slope in the data. Possibilities include calculating the derivatives (which probably won't work well on noisy data such as shown), or gradients , or using a Savitzky-Golay filter or piecewise linear smoothing spline fits . Randall 's light gray figures may be suggesting this method.\nThe other is the so-called 'expert' method, which involves tilting the page the graph is printed on to view changes in slope better. For small changes in an underlying trend, similar to that apparently shown in the comic, direct visual inspection cannot always identify or even reveal the effect. The comic shows, however, that by taking the page and rotating it in just the right way, the foreshortened perspective can make certain details much more apparent, allowing the 'expert' to see at a glance that there is a change in the slope. Ironically, tilting the comic to make the original roughly resemble the perspective of the 'tilted' version graph shown in the comic shows that the right-hand panel is slightly exaggerated for visual effect. The use of perspective to make information pop into the audience's view has been used by artists for centuries .\nHowever, applying such an approach to data plots can run into errors \u2014 the primary one being parallax error from the oblique viewing angle causing the observer to not necessarily identify or clearly find the point at which the slope changes. It also does not reveal any data about the quantitative value of the change in slope, merely proving the existence of one. Furthermore, noisy data might show an apparent slope change that is not representative of an actual change in the underlying data, so even more advanced statistics testing the hypothesis of whether an apparent slope change is real may likely be a good idea.\nThe title text then goes on to say that, while such a trick is useful to identify that there is some change in slope, in order to pretend to know it exactly one must revert to statistics (the \"novice method\") to obtain some form of information, defeating some of the premise of the comic. This at least produces a semblance of statistical rigor although, once an answer appears obvious, data could be interpreted to reach an answer that you are now expecting rather than revealing something of more statistically useful significance.\nHow to detect a change in the slope of your data\n[First column, on the left] Novice method: [A graph, with dots forming a rough line, math formulas, and sub graphs] Do a bunch of statistics\n[Second column, on the right] Expert method: [Perspective view of the previous graph, with the legend \"Hey look, it bends here\" and an arrow pointing to the graph] Tip the graph sideways\n"}

Some preliminary data |\n","explanation":"Many if not most scientific research papers present a hypothesis and the result of testing the hypothesis. It is a common misconception that only that kind of research should be considered \"science\", but it is one of the key elements of the scientific method .  Scientific papers should also have titles which describe the content of the papers, which may or may not reflect the full hypothesis in some abbreviated form. See also 2456: Types of Scientific Paper .\nCueball is writing a research paper with a clickbait , puffery and insufficiently descriptive title of \"Check out this cool microbe we found.\" His colleague Megan asks him whether science is supposed to be about formulating a hypothesis and testing it. Cueball agrees, changing the title to \"Is our lab really good at finding cool microbes? Some preliminary data.\" However, that is still an overly promotional and insufficiently descriptive clickbait title, purporting to be a study of the authors' own competence, which would be highly unusual because of the lack of objectivity due to the authors being the subject of investigation. Clickbait is a recurring theme on xkcd, recently considered within science publications in 2001: Clickbait-Corrected p-Value . The title of a research article describing a novel organism will often contain the author(s) proposed Linnaean name for it, which is granted as their prerogative within certain limitations. [1]\nEmpirical investigations and analysis papers almost always state and test a hypothesis, but there are many kinds of scientific papers which usually do not, including literature reviews , which qualitatively summarize the results of other papers; meta-analyses , which quantitatively summarize the results and quality of other work; observational reports (or case studies \u2014 not to be confused with observational studies , a kind of empirical analysis), which present data and a chronicle of its collection often without analysis, testing, or interpretation; conference papers , which present preliminary work without peer review; definition papers , which attempt to formalize terms used in divergent ways in prior work; syntheses , which present alternative views combining multiple and often conflicting concepts; comparative studies , which compare and contrast a class of concepts; interpretive papers , showing a different perspective on previous work; technical reports , which may present information on a specific procedural topic or progress and results, if any, in a field; opinion and editorial essays , which are intended to argue a point of view persuasively; book reviews, which summarize monographs or biographies; and grant proposals , which make the case for funding a project. Mathematical or logic research papers which don't involve empirical observations or uncertainty would be considered technical reports in other fields. Engineering work can be reported as an empirical investigation or a technical report. Empirical research articles which do present and test a hypothesis are usually written in American Psychological Association (APA) style .\nCueball seems to want to author an observational report, but Megan would prefer an empirical investigation or analysis, perhaps because they may be more likely to be accepted by peer reviewed journals, and as such are more prestigious than mere conference papers, \"letters\" or \"communications\" as observational reports are often published. However, research articles describing the discovery of new microbes in prestigious peer-reviewed journals are often published as observational reports, [2] [3] [4] so Megan's concerns may be unfounded; even if so, the editors of any reputable journal would almost certainly require a far more descriptive and less overtly promotional title from Cueball. The question remains whether an initial submission with a catchy clickbait title might get more prompt attention from editors and reviewers.\nIn the title text, a conflict of interest statement says that the authors hope their results are correct because \"we all want to be cool people who are good at science.\" A scientific publication's potential conflict of interest usually refers to the authors' financial, familial, or other external interests in the research outcomes. The disclosure statement does not describe a conflict between the authors' extrinsic motivations and factors influencing the accuracy and neutrality of their work; in fact it claims the opposite, an alignment between their intrinsic motivations and the goal of producing high quality work, which should go without saying.

Designer: No! I can do this!\n[Caption below the panel:] Every designer's dream is to finally invent a non-confusing faucet control.\n","explanation":"A variety of faucet controls have been designed for the control of a shower or sink's water output; however, Randall seems to find all the existing options to be inadequate in some way and posits in this comic that designers share a desire to create a more ideal design. The comic shows one such designer, looking unkempt and rambling like a madman as he explains to an off-screen character how his new faucet design works. The off-screen character promptly tells him that he should get some sleep, a request which the designer ignores in favor of continuing the search for the \"perfect\" water faucet.\nIn general, a faucet's output has two independent parameters: flow velocity and temperature; some particularly frustrating faucet controls only offer one degree of freedom which simultaneously turns up the flow rate and the temperature, and thus cannot fully explore the shower-space (making it sometimes difficult to find a comfortable setting).  Some faucets can adjust both parameters but only have a single lever which must be angled along degrees of freedom which are not always labeled clearly or intuitively, and this may also irk Randall.  Other faucets have two independent controls for the flow of cold water and hot water; however, while these are highly granular, it can be difficult to adjust the parameters independently e.g. change the temperature without changing the flow, or changing the flow without changing the temperature.\nWhile two-handle faucets may seem simple in the abstract, they are imperfect in practice.  In older houses or those with hot water systems based on tankless or instant hot water heaters, the hot water pressure is rarely the same as the cold water pressure.  This can cause problems with cold water flowing back into the hot line, creating temperature drifts, unexpected changes in temperature based on slight input changes, and non-reproducibility in shower settings.\nNewer systems include thermostatic mixing valves which are designed to alleviate these problems; ideally, they contain one control for temperature and one for flow, which would seem to fit the \"non-confusing\" brief and solve Randall's problems.  However, designing a system technically functional and making it intuitive (and making it work in practice for all water supply systems) is non-trivial, so Randall may have had trouble with even these faucets in the past.\nThe experience of a shower being affected by a significant change in usage of water elsewhere in the building (a running washing machine clicking into or out of a rinse-cycle, or the sudden use of a flush-toilet) is a typical one in any place without deliberately over-engineered plumbing. Purpose built hotels may have an in-built degree of resilience of this kind, but over many temporary stay-overs by guests (each new set having to become familiar with the plumbing) will develop wear and tear that later guests will not be automatically aware of \u2014 including the gradual wearing off of the traditional red and blue arrows intended to show the polarity of hot-and-cold controls.\nThe title text is a hyperbolic and slightly sarcastic explanation of the merits of a faucet system, presumably from its designer. It describes that the user can identify an undesirable result, e.g. of scalding water, through a trial-and-error feedback loop. But, with a decidedly long delay in response time as the scalding (then non-scalding) mix works its way through the system, it means that they are left waiting for any adjustments made to prove themselves as useful (or not) whilst still experiencing the prior state of the water.\n[A designer with short, messy hair and a scuffed face stands in front of a whiteboard.

Players in such positions are eligible for being judged guilty of an offside offence if they become involved in the ongoing play before rectifying their status. It is of special importance to know the different players' positions at the exact moment the ball gets passed, rather than when the passed ball may be received or the offside player is otherwise considered active. But in relativistic spacetime there is no universal definition of an exact moment, beyond a single point, as time may run at different speeds for multiple observers in varying situations (where they are moving relative to each other, are influenced by differing local gravity or \u2013 as seems very likely in this example \u2013 both). An additional joke is that even in regular soccer, the offside rule is notoriously difficult to fully understand (or explain to someone).\nThe title text is written in the style of the beginning to a Wikipedia article on the topic. It alludes to the fact that most countries in the world refer to the sport with that particular obscure offside rule as football (or some translation thereof, like f\u00fatbol or Fu\u00dfball) while the USA, Canada, Ireland, Japan and Australia tend to call it soccer, which comes from the British shortening of \"association football\", because they already used the name \"football\" for gridiron football, Gaelic football, or Australian football (which share a common ancestry with the other sport, along with \"rugby football\", hence the name).\n[On a gray \"rubber sheet\" visualization of a gravity well is drawn some of the lines of a standard Association Football (Soccer) pitch.

Megan: Fine. Your cat weighs 3x10 -30 solar masses. Ponytail: Okay. Better.\n","explanation":"Space is big and the things that are in space can also end up being very big themselves. As a result, most quantities in astronomy have huge scales. For example, Earth has a mass 10 23 times more than the average human, and the Sun is 10 5 times more than that, which itself is 10 12 times less massive than the Milky Way. The same applies to speeds, distances, and time, which can often be measured in terms of light speed, light-years, and millions or billions of years. Because of this, it's a truly unusual occurrence for anything in space to end up in the fairly narrow range of scales of mass, size, speed, or time that humans can easily grasp.\nPonytail , apparently a scientist researching something related to Earth's orbit, finds that on the date in question (January 1, although the year is not specified), Earth will be approaching the sun at a velocity of 65 miles per hour\u2014an extremely common and normal-sounding velocity to American ears, often used as a speed limit on highways in the US. Ponytail is clearly a little thrown off by this, and remarks that she finds it \"suspicious\" when reasonably human-scaled numbers come up.\nShe then extends this discomfort to things that should be measured in regular numbers, such as the weight of cats. The vet, Megan , is seemingly used to this problem (perhaps she gets a lot of astronomers, or Ponytail has a hypochondriac cat), so she restates the 12-lb weight of Ponytail's cat in solar masses. Since using this unit yields an incredibly small number, 3\u00d710 -30 (a three preceded by a decimal point and 29 zeroes), it evidently sounds more plausible to the astronomer. This weight is in fact about 13 lb 2 oz (about 5.5 kilograms), slightly heavier than the initial figure given for the cat, but within rounding error for the single digit of precision that Megan uses. According to 2205: Types of Approximation that rounding error is unusually small for an astronomer, though. Also, the usage of weight gives the word \"scales\" in \"scales should all be incomprehensible\" a double meaning because scales are used to weigh things, including cats. A scale that returns weights in solar masses would indeed be incomprehensible to most people. However, this could be unintentional on Randall's part.\nThe Earth's orbital velocity around the Sun is far above any \"normal\" scales (around 30 kilometers per second or 108,000 kilometers per hour). However, Earth has a pretty circular orbit around the Sun, so most of this speed ends up being tangential (sideways) rather than radial (towards or away from) the Sun, which is the value relevant for Ponytail's calculations. On January 1, Earth's radial velocity is close to its smallest value because we reach our closest point to the Sun in the first few days of January each year (in 2023, perihelion happens on January 4) so by January 1, it's nearly come to a standstill before it starts traveling away from the Sun again. On the other hand, by April 3, 2023, Earth will be receding from the Sun by almost 500 meters per second or 1800 kilometers per hour, a less normal speed for the average person to encounter in everyday life. [ citation needed ] 65 miles per hour is approximately equal to 105 kilometers per hour, although the even more typical scientific value (in SI derived units) would be 29 meters per second.\nThe title text suggests that laser pointers \"love chasing\" a new cat with a weight of 12 solar masses (an inversion of the typical cat behavior of chasing laser pointer dots ). A 12 solar mass cat would have the dominant gravitation well in our solar system, which would make everything fall towards the cat \u2013 including laser pointers. Furthermore, all gravitational fields bend light towards their center; a 12 solar mass object could bend light quite a lot.  The path of the light from a laser pointer aimed near such a cat would bend towards it or \"chase\" it. In fact, anything with 12 solar masses would have a Schwarzschild radius of around 36 kilometers, so any cat-sized thing with that mass would be a black hole, drawing all light within a 72-kilometer sphere around it into its singularity.\n[Ponytail is standing in front of a whiteboard writing on it with a pen, while Cueball looks over her shoulder from behind her.

Miss Lenhart: We now know planets have no precise location, but instead occupy probabilistic orbitals ... Header: Astronomy\n","explanation":"This comic parodies the analogy of early-20th century models of atomic structure to the structure of the solar system. Electrons were thought to be orbiting the nucleus \"like planets around a sun\" until it was discovered that their locations are probabilistic. The comic flips this on its head: instead of the atomic structure model lacking a known causal relationship, it is now the planetary system that is quantum mechanical in nature, split into probabilistic orbitals .\nMiss Lenhart is shown here to be teaching an astronomy class, and claims that it was thought that the planets moved around the sun like electrons around the nucleus before this model was superseded by the probabilistic quantum mechanical view of orbital locations for planetary movement.\nThis is another one of the comics where Lenhart tries to fool her class, as in for instance 1519: Venus . Most likely it is not to be taken to be true that her world is like this, or that she believes in it. She just likes to mess with her students.\nIf what she said was to be taken literally it would suggests that in this reality not only do electrons have distinct bodies that orbit a nucleus, but also that atomic structure was known before the correct planetary one.\nIn reality, the description of probabilistic orbitals is applied to the electrons in an atom; quantum uncertainty effects are not large enough to notice at the planetary scale [ citation needed ] . However, such a concept has been prominently featured in the video game Outer Wilds , with its Quantum Moon. Immanuel Velikovsky proposed that our solar system's planets could jump between orbits suddenly, quantum-mechanically, in the same way that electrons do around atomic nuclei. This proposal was not well received in academia.  Real astronomers do talk about probability distributions of orbiting bodies, especially in the context of collision calculations, but it's not because the position of a satellite or asteroid is in a quantum superposition of states; rather, it is our less than infinite accuracy of measurement and knowledge of those orbits, plus their evolution under the influence of less-predictable effects like space weather or other still unidentified additional factors, that makes long-term estimates progressively more uncertain.\nThe title text is Miss Lenhart trying to use the first joke to set up another that builds on the first. She says that the consequence of planets having probabilistic locations would mean that they would spend some time in the lower-probability locations closer to or further from the Sun. The Earth's real orbit is in a so called habitable zone where the temperature allows liquid water and thus allows  life as we know it to exist. A probabilistic Earth would spend most of its time in the habitable zone, which is why life exists, but then, in short periods when it is outside the zone, some life would die. The title text claims this is why life on Earth is mortal, thus indirectly implying that life only dies in the periods where Earth leaves the habitable zone, and that life staying in the habitable zone would be immortal.\nThere was already an orbital model parody made in 2100: Models of the Atom , which featured the planetary one, but at that time it was solely for the humorous insertion of 'facts' into the subject of atomic theory.\n[Miss Lenhart is teaching a class.

Off-panel voice 1: Hooray! Off-panel voice 2: Wait.\n","explanation":"In this comic, Beret Guy announces that their hydroelectric dam has reached \"Q > 1\" supposedly meaning that it is producing more water than is flowing into it. If this includes rain falling into the dam, this would violate the physical law of conservation of mass. (If it is interpreted more literally to include only surface water flow, then it would be possible if rainfall exceeded evaporation.)  Over the lifetime of a dam, the volume of water that passes through the outflow gates will be less than the total volume of water precipitated in the catchment area due to evaporation, seepage, and other losses. To produce more water, matter would have to be created. If only a short time period is considered, a dam can naturally release more water than is fed into it, especially during dry seasons or after a dam break. The title \"breakthrough\" could refer to this, but it would not be a cause for celebration. While one audience member celebrates, another expresses concern.\nThe comic parodies fusion reactors , a type of electrical generator that can use deuterium and tritium as inputs to produce helium and a large amount of power. However, maintaining a fusion reaction has historically been difficult, and fusion reactors often require more external power than they generate. In recent years, advances in fusion technology have increased the energy output of fusion reactors to more than the input. This comic is most likely a reference to the announcement of the first Q > 1 fusion reaction at the US National Ignition Facility , which was scheduled for the day after the comic was released. The symbol Q is used to refer to the fusion energy gain factor , the ratio of power generated by a fusion reactor to the energy used to maintain it. An energy source is only useful if it produces more power than it uses [ citation needed ] , so Q > 1 means the reactor is generating net energy. Q can also represent the volumetric flow rate of water through a hydroelectric dam, and in this case, a Q > 1 would not have significant meaning.\nThe title text further confuses the issue by introducing nuclear fission and equating the hydroelectric dam with a heavy water reactor , which is a type of nuclear fission reactor that uses deuterium oxide as a moderator. This is also a play on words, as the weight of water is used to move turbines that drive generators at a hydroelectric dam.\n[Beret Guy is standing on a podium behind a lectern.

Among the parameters being measured \u2014 those being angle of throw, throwing speed, spinning speed, and weight of the ball \u2014 all four graphs encompass a range far larger than would be useful for reference by a bowler. The latter three in particular are on logarithmic scales , leading up to values that are impossible for a human to achieve. [ citation needed ]\nThe first line graph indicates that a bowler has the greatest chance of achieving a strike by aiming the ball directly at the pins, with the chance of a strike decreasing rapidly as the ball is aimed to the left or the right. The closer you aim to the pins, the more likely it is you hit them. [ citation needed ] While a novice bowler may have difficulty achieving a 0\u00b0 angle roll, their roll would still not come close to a -90\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 angle (due left or due right), much less a -180\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 angle (which, in either case, would be the opposite direction from the pins). Unlike with the other graphs, it is physically possible for a bowler to aim the ball at any angle, albeit not permissible under bowling rules; aiming the ball at an angle which deviates significantly from 0\u00b0 would most likely cause the ball to end up in the gutter, while more violent or wildly aimed actions could create a risk of the ball going into one of the other lanes or missing the lanes entirely, which could annoy, anger, or even endanger other bowlers and employees of the bowling alley.\nThe second graph indicates that a bowler has the greatest chance of achieving a strike by throwing the ball about 5\u201320 m\/s (11\u201345 mph, 18\u201372 kph), with the chance of a strike decreasing as the speed is increased or decreased. Most bowlers cannot throw more than 45 m\/s (100 mph or 160 kph). [ citation needed ] According to the graph, any throw faster than 100 m\/s would cause equipment damage, and then widespread destruction several orders of magnitude later. (Possibly a reference to Relativistic Baseball .) The graph ends at the speed of light , as it is physically impossible to throw anything faster.\nThe third graph concerns the rotational speed of the ball. The \"ball explodes\" section is a reference to one of Randall 's favorite equations, which is that an object cannot spin faster than the square root of its specific tensile strength. Spinning the ball any faster than this limit would cause the bowling ball to lose its structural integrity and explosively disintegrate. At particularly high speeds, the material of the ball would be flung outwards at a significant fraction of the speed of light, causing, as in the second graph, widespread destruction (possibly a reference to One-Second Day .)\nThe fourth graph in this comic illustrates a bowler's probability of a strike with a ball whose mass ranges from 10 0 kg (2.2 pounds) to close to 10 10 kg (over 22 billion pounds), and continues by indicating that balls even larger than that would cause \"equipment damage\" (up to 10 20 kg) or the creation of a black hole (starting from around 10 25 kg and up). In reality, a ball would be very likely to cause equipment damage at much lower masses than 10 10 kg. [ citation needed ] The last entry on the x-axis of this graph is 10 40 kg, which is about 5 billion times the mass of the Sun . The United States Bowling Congress requires all bowling balls to weigh no more than 16 pounds (that is, a mass of no more than 7.257 kg), with no minimum weight. Hence, if the x-axis of the graph ran from, say, 0 to 8 kg, the graph might actually impart some useful information.\nIn theory, an angle of exactly -180\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 with an extremely high speed, but less than escape velocity, could result in a strike if the ball traveled around the world and struck the pins from behind, after breaking through the wall behind the pins.\nThe title text continues the trend of providing unhelpful information by stating that the optimal place to stand when trying to bowl a strike is inside the bowling alley, but mentions the possibility of \"any establishment uphill from one\" working, with a little luck. This suggests the possibility of rolling the bowling ball downhill, in to the bowling alley and the pins.\n[The header is surrounded on either side by small drawings of two bowling pins and a bowling ball.] Data for Optimal Bowling\n[Four line graphs are depicted.

The viewer is capable of exploring various bodies and planets within the play area, many containing easter eggs alluding to the book What If? 2 and previous xkcd comics. The flight mechanics are largely, if not entirely, Newtonian, so the vessel is capable of using the gravity of planets to alter its trajectory or even enter orbit. The spaceship has indicator circles around it which appear when a gravitational body comes into range, showing the direction towards their center of gravity and the size of the body. A circle also appears around the spaceship whenever it collides with a gravitational body, acting as a shield. The shield remains until the player orients the spaceship upright so its landing gear can deploy.\nWith a keyboard the arrow keys rotate the spaceship and accelerate it forward and backward. You can also use the standard first person shooter keys 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd', and the standard vi text editor navigation keys 'h', 'j', 'k', and 'l' to control the spaceship. Despite some ships having no unique backward texture, all ships can reverse. On mobile the comic will full screen, pressing either side of the center rotates the spaceship, and pressing in the center accelerates it forward.\nIt is fairly easy to fly between planets as long as you pay attention to orbital mechanics; don't just floor the accelerator. The background stars show your velocity and orientation relative to the nearest gravity well.  If you are having difficulties navigating space, point towards a gravity orb and accelerate for only a few seconds.  Wait until the background stars spin wildly, and then reduce your velocity to 0 before gently accelerating towards the object.\nPlaying on mobile: Various additional glitches may occur. Having a starting position slightly below the take-off pad means you're already 'glitched' inside the planet from the off. Escaping the planet may need inverted 'accelerating' (turning perpendicular to the local vertical, and thrusting backwards until you can glitch back out into more open space. You may also be trapped within the cannonball 'orbit', with seemingly inconsistent collision-detection, such that you can be sat with landing gear extended upon features (projectile tracks, etc) that seem not to count as solid for most other purposes.\nThere is no \"universal\" point of view \u2014 the bottom of the window, \"down\", is oriented towards the object exerting the most gravity upon the player. Multiple things found in this comic draw attention to this, such as how on Earth Ponytail says to White Hat, \"I checked downforeveryoneorjustme.com and it says just me\", and he replies \"Yeah, I guess down isn't down for everyone.\"\nThroughout the play area are coins that change the spaceship into different rockets and non-space based vehicles, including humans.\nThe comic promotes Randall's new book What If? 2 , which was released in September and is available for purchase. Many of the planets contain references to various What If? articles.\nThe comic is similar to 1608: Hoverboard , which celebrated Thing Explainer instead.\nThe following is an incomplete table of features:\nView the data that is embedded in the comic on this page .\nMaps created by the Community:\nVarious modes and hacks have been found or developed by the community, and can be activated by opening the browser console (F12, Ctrl-Shift-I or Cmd-Option-I to open your browser's developer tools, then choose the Console tab) and typing a command. Click to expand:\n\nThe objects in the mini-universe of this browser game are all at fixed positions and do not interact through gravity, however, the ship controlled by the player is affected by gravity. While this makes it technically a relatively easy integration problem (of the position of the player ship forward in time), the integrator used seems to be a relatively simple one - and certainly not a symplectic one, because it does not conserve angular momentum. This can be seen when one manages to get into orbit around some object, e.g. the core of the sun. The orbit slowly decays over time.\nThe logic for extending the landing legs and landing is rather simple. A ship can (normally) land if it is facing away from the surface it collides with, and if its momentum is more-or-less directed towards the surface. Once landing is triggered, the ship will rotate to face directly away from the object exerting the most gravity on the player, regardless of how sloped the surface is. The only way to get into space again is to accelerate forwards, as neither turning nor accelerating backwards cancels the landed state. All of this can be abused to land on almost everything. To land on the underside of an object, simply point your ship away from the object and slowly accelerate backwards to counteract the force of gravity. Landing on the side of an object is more difficult, as ships cannot accelerate sideways. The first method is to accelerate backwards to launch yourself upwards and towards the object so that at the top of your arc you will collide with the object. Then, rotate your ship accordingly to land. Method two is to just repeatedly slam your back of your ship into the object until you land. Note that with any of these weird landing methods, your ship will turn to face away from the source of gravity and can clip into objects.\nExecuting window.python(\"import antigravity\") or python(\"import antigravity\") as Javascript on the page will reverse gravity, multiplying the gravity constant by -1.\nExecuting window.ze.goggles() or ze.goggles() as Javascript on the page will show a warning in the console: \" they do nothing! \"\nWelcome!\nTo celebrate the world of what if? 2, here is your very own planet to explore!\nGive someone the science question-and-answer book what if? 2 for Christmas:\nxkcd.com\/whatif2\n"}

The comic jokes that a single data point can somehow be of such interest in isolation that the other data may be disregarded. In reality, a single datum can almost never represent what the information in the related data taken together indicate.\nRandall 's caption states that a figure illustrating a single datum thus constitutes a \"science power move.\" (Similarly to the science tips of previous comics.)\nThis is most likely intended as facetious satire, because the purpose of a chart or graph figure is to present multiple data which would be less clear as tabular or textual data, so there is rarely any reason to devote a figure to a single datum, regardless of its importance. The canonical counterexample is presentation of the mean of a group of measurements . ( Figure here \u2014 note the point's specular reflection indicating 3-D.) A less common counterexample might be when an interesting singular matrix decomposition such as an eigenvector is characterized, but this would only occur when such a datum is highly dimensional. It also could be a joke about papers which only highlight particularly interesting or significant data without including the background measurements or similar mundane information necessary to fully understand or reproduce the findings. While there are accepted reasons for this practice , it can be annoying when trying to follow an otherwise useful procedure or comparing aspects of the results the authors did not anticipate.\nThe title text suggests relegating all the other data to supplementary materials, presumably to avoid detracting from the single \"cool\" datum.\n[A graph is shown.

A common stereotype is that men will revert to infantile behavior when miserably sick. This can be annoying to the people around them, but they typically tolerate such behavior out of compassion. The joke in this comic is that Hairy spoke via a telehealth appointment to Ponytail , a medical professional who explicitly advised him to act out, since his condition has no effective medical treatment. He takes her advice to \"act like you're the first person ever to have a cold\" literally, stating it specifically when his companion asks about it. Given xkcd's humor in the past, this may be supposed to trick the cold virus into thinking that it has not had a lot of time to evolve to infect human cells effectively so that it does not infect Hairy's cells as effectively.\nThis comic was published during a \"tripledemic\" in the U.S., involving COVID-19 , influenza , and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, a frequent cause of common colds) infections, the latter of which do not have readily available effective treatments, other than to wait them out with plenty of rest and fluids (provided that symptoms do not require hospitalization). It expounds on the finding that \"talking about troublesome events, including events with which one is dissatisfied, may ... result in improved physiological health.\" (Kowalski, R.M. (2002) \"Whining, griping, and complaining: positivity in the negativity\" Journal of Clinical Psychology 58 (9):1023\u201335.)\nThe title text describes a similar study, but where the institutional review board (IRB) halted the study because the participants were too annoying. This is ironic since they were supposed to whine annoyingly for the sake of the experiment. IRBs are expected to review the ethics of a research project, with particular attention paid to the well-being of the subjects. Whining is not usually considered dangerous, [ citation needed ] but in this case it was presumably so intolerable to the Board (or perhaps the control group, who were presumably forbidden from whining while sick) that they had to put a stop to it.\n[Hairy sitting on a chair in front of a computer screen, with unkempt hair, and a line of figurative bubbles emerge from the back of his head to indicate a muzzy feeling in his head.

Depending on the measurement method, [1] Pando is the largest living organism on earth, and is thereby also the largest tree on earth. By dry mass (mass not including water), Pando is the largest living thing humans have found. There is one fungus in Oregon which may weigh more including water, but a fungus is not a tree .\nPando is a tree colony, a type of clonal colony made of trees. Clonal colonies all form from the same seed or other origin, and are all genetically identical. Tree colonies spread using their extensive root system. Under all trees are roots , which gather nutrients and water from soil. On clonal trees (such as the quaking aspen , Pando's species), when roots from one tree surface they can form another stalk\/tree, remaining the same genetic stock; this is unlike propagation by seeds. This clone then grows its own root network and is part of the clonal colony. Crucially, the linking roots between 'generations' of the plant do not naturally separate, so all effective clones stay attached. Each such stalk still has an individually limited lifespan of decades to centuries, but the colony can persist and propagate in this manner for millennia. For example, the only known wild example of Lomatia tasmanica , also known as King's lomatia , is a clonal shrub thought to be at least 43,600 years old, and Pando itself is thought to be around 14,000 years old.\nChristmas is a celebration on the 25th of December, traditionally commemorating the birth of Jesus . The celebration is often claimed to be built heavily upon pagan traditions, [2] (though this is disputed by some historians [3] ) as well as on annual social customs. It has evolved into a more secular event for many. This comic was published on the 23rd of December, two days before Christmas, or Christmas Eve Eve .\nThe concept of a Christmas tree is rooted in various pre-Christian folkloric traditions and, in the modern era, may be adapted or adopted as desired by local and personal circumstances. It need not be an evergreen tree with an angel or star atop, though that is the oft-depicted image, but can be any handy plant or artificial substitute strewn with decorations and\/or lights as the owner wishes. People and places often compete to hold the record for the largest Christmas tree. At time of writing, the officially tallest Christmas tree was a 64.36 m (221 ft) tall Douglas-fir that was displayed in Northgate Shopping Center , [ actual citation needed ] Seattle, WA in 1950. [4] [5] The one with the most area is likely the Christmas tree display in Gubbio , a town in Umbria, Italy , where hundreds of trees on a mountain face are lit up with light to form a Christmas tree shape.\nIn this comic, Randall proposes putting Christmas lights all the way around Pando to turn it into (technically) a Christmas tree. As Pando is the world's largest tree, if this plan were carried out, it would safely take the record for largest Christmas tree and hold it for quite some time. In the inset map, Randall has drawn the path of the Christmas lights as a convex hull around the edge of Pando. Roughly tracing Pando on Google Maps reveals its perimeter to be roughly 2.77 km or 1.72 miles, or roughly 9,000 ft. Allowing a little wiggle-room for differing levels of accuracy, and possibly the extra length required to suspend the shallow catenary loops of the lights and wrap them around the various supporting branches, 9,300 ft of Christmas lights seems about right.\nThe title text suggests that similarly to how trees that make up Pando are interconnected by underground roots, the gifts under the proposed Christmas tree are interconnected by underground ribbons. It may also be a reference to fungus, which often grow beneath trees, and can be connected by vast underground mycelial networks, suggesting that the christmas presents are the fruiting bodies of a similar network (perhaps a reference to comic 2246).\n[The main comic frame is a profile view of a number of separated trees, of varying heights and maturity, across each of which (of those with sufficient height) has apparently been draped a single chain of decorative lights that goes from off-image at one side to off-image at the other.]\n[Inset in the bottom right is a mini-map implicating that these light-linked 'trees' are actually all risers from a single large superorganism (as a shaded complex but contiguous shape labelled \"Pando\"), the map has a \"N\"orth pointer, a scale bar indicating the length of \"1,000 ft\" (approximately a third of the shaded mass's full width) and a convex hull perimeter line tightly fitting the shaded area that has an indicative arrow from a label informing us that its length would be \"9,300 ft\".]\n[Caption below:] Christmas Science Fact: Pando is approximately 9,300 feet of lights away from being the world's largest Christmas Tree.\n"}

The characters are discussing which to use during an evening of tabletop gaming. The group has a running competition to see who can mention fake apps or services without being called out. The idea being that, since there are so many, it is difficult to identify which are real.\nCueball mentions three food delivery services, Grubhub , DoorDash , and Food.net, and Ponytail asks him to reimburse her using Venmo , PayPal , or Yahoo Cash. Cueball expresses skepticism about Yahoo Cash, after which Ponytail admits it's a fake service (it's a spoof of Google Pay ) and is thus obligated to pay for Cueball's meal. (Incidentally, Yahoo does provide a money transfer service to facilitate private party gambling on fantasy sports , called Yahoo Fantasy Wallet , but it uses PayPal.) Food.net, which Cueball mentioned without being called out, is not a real service; https:\/\/food.net exists but is \"not available for use,\" and is not related to food.\nBased on Ponytail's offer, if someone is correctly called out then they apparently must pay for the player who caught them, but what happens when a player isn't caught (e.g. when Cueball mentioned Food.net) isn't clear. The rules might be similar to variants of the card game often known as \" Cheat ,\" in which a successful bluff merely allows play to continue on until someone is caught bluffing or incorrectly accuses another player.\nThe title text offers a tip for winning the competition after being called out for mentioning a fake service: building a working version of it and then mentioning it again the next week. While it could be possible to prototype a user interface and possibly use it to perform food deliveries with a very limited number of drivers in a small area, or provide a front end interface to an existing money transfer service with strong API support, building a full-fledged viable service for either in a week is humorously beyond the reach of typical gamers. Also, as in Ponytail's case, it could cause trademark issues with brand names.\n[Cueball, Megan, and Ponytail are sitting at a table to order food.

[Caption below the panel:] Huge space news: Astronomers have discovered a new Lagrange point just outside Cleveland.\n","explanation":"In celestial mechanics, the Lagrange points are points of equilibrium for small-mass objects under the influence of two massive orbiting bodies. Or in simpler terms, positions in space where objects can float motionless relative to the defining bodies.\nThere are five traditional Lagrange points. Two form equilateral triangles with the two massive objects (in this case the Earth and the Sun), and three more are collinear with the massive objects. The L 1 , L 2 , and L 3 points are unstable, as any drifting off the point (e.g. due to the gravity of other bodies) might quickly increase the tendency to depart the area. However, there are quasi-stable Halo orbits around these points, like the one used by the James Webb Space Telescope . The L 4 and L 5 points can actually retain objects stably over long periods, resulting in the Sun-Jupiter L 4 and L 5 points capturing the Trojan Asteroids .\nRandall claims that a sixth Lagrange point has been discovered outside of Cleveland , Ohio . This is pretty obviously farcical, [ citation needed ] as this would be part of the Earth and thus not gravitationally balanced between Earth and the Sun, though it is balanced by the countering forces that hold anything stable on the surface of any body: gravity and electromagnetism . The joke here is that there actually is a small village named LaGrange, OH (population 2,595 in 2020) just outside Cleveland ( map ). However, the village name is spelled with a capital G, unlike Joseph-Louis Lagrange after which the Lagrange points were named.\nThere is, however, a Lagrange in Maine , a Lagrange in Virginia and a Lagrange Township in Illinois which all use the lower case g in their spelling like Joseph-Louis Lagrange.  There are also twenty-six other communities in the United states with a spelling of LaGrange or La Grange, as well as four in France and two in Australia with one of the three spellings.  This includes La Grange, Texas which became famous as the title of a ZZ Top song .\nThe title text mentions Akron and Toledo , two other large cities in Ohio. It says that their gravitational influence is the reason why orbits around the LaGrange L6 are unstable. The Lagrange points are solutions for a simplified three-body system, and orbits around them may be disrupted if additional bodies such as moons or planets are close enough or massive enough to cumulatively exert significant gravitational forces over time (the Moon does factor into the Earth-Sun L1 and L2 Lagrange points, especially, but that can be accounted for in the station-keeping measures already required). Trying to orbit around a point on the ground would, of course, run into much more serious problems, such as the ground.\nGrey on white diagram of the Earth orbiting the Sun, not to scale.

Usually, such procedures are intended to adjust a  patient's corneas to correct vision problems, as an alternative to glasses and contact lenses. Cueball has apparently had the digits 2023 etched into his eyes as an alternative to wearing novelty glasses. While scleral tattooing is performed for cosmetic reasons, and corneal tattooing for both cosmetic and vision benefits, the efficacy and safety of either process is not universally accepted. The laser procedure has damaged Cueball's vision so much that he mistakes a newcomer to the party resembling Hairy as Rob . Realizing he made a mistake, his second guess is that the new arrival is named Mike.\nIn the title text, an earlier conversation with his ophthalmologist has established Cueball's problems are due to the laser burning the digits straight onto his eyeballs, without regard to endangering his vision. Most previous depictions of Cueball have not shown him wearing glasses. Laser eye surgery was referenced along with other laser equipment in 1681: Laser Products .\n[Ponytail, White Hat, Megan, Cueball, and Hairy are standing around.

It's kind of a pet peeve.\n","explanation":"In this comic, Cueball is walking along next to a robot holding a conversation \u2013 from this we can infer the robot is sentient or even sapient . Cueball is complaining to said robot about the problems of biology, especially his own biology, whining that \"biology is the worst\" and \"bodies have all these random problems\". The human body does have many challenges, ranging from the mildly inefficient to the lethal-without-warning , and culminating in irreversible senescence and (unless you're Tolkien ) obligate mortality. The robot, an abiological entity ( some exceptions apply ) responds by posing a question which may or may not be intended as rhetorical.\nThe robot thus highlights an advantage that biological bodies have \u2013 i.e., the ability to heal themselves, while metal robots like this one don't and probably must seek out repairs. However, Cueball immediately points out that this ability only works \"sometimes\", and is often painful. First and foremost, one must actually survive a hole if they wish to heal from it, as death comes with some pretty big impacts on their continuing ability to do so. [ citation needed ] Secondly holes can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, in many widths and depths with many further complications (including the aforementioned death). For example, a small hole made for an earring would be easy to close, whereas one carved by a 91.4cm mortar shell would be less easy to heal. There is also ambiguity in what counts as a hole. Is a cut a hole? Is surgery, etc? This variability is likely why Cueball says \"Sometimes\".\nHe also states that \"it\" is \"not exactly fun\". This is either sarcasm or an understatement, as some holes can really hurt. \"It\" is implied to be the holes themselves, as while the healing process can hurt, the formation of the hole (such as being shot) is often a lot more painful. [ citation needed ]\nThe title text is Cueball apologizing for his whining, explaining his frustration with certain things such as particular fruits and unexpected robotic incursions. He appears to equate these two issues, where most normal people would consider one a minor irritation, and the other a serious threat (though he may be deliberately making this comparison sardonically). Even when a robot is used purposefully for cutting into a human (such as robotic surgery), it should be expected and consented to. There are few situations where cutting open a human without consent would be considered socially, morally, legally or cybernetically acceptable in most countries [ citation needed ] (one example would be a trained medic trying to saving an unconscious person\u2019s life by urgently cutting into them in some way ).\nPart of the humor may also derive from the fact that Cueball is complaining about things which the Robot could only dream of for its own future (self-repair, automatic recharging from abundant naturally occurring proteins [food], self-replication without external construction, etc). This is similar to 1839: Doctor Visit where the doctor marvels at the fact that \"your body has been moving around for years and still works at all. My USB cables fray after like a month\". Some people argue [ citation needed ] that self-replicating, self-repairing sentient robotics would in their complexity be quite similar to biological systems and might even suffer from similar problems.\n[Cueball is walking to the left with a robot following behind him.

A person from the audience talks to him from off-panel. The whiteboard shows an Euler diagram with two large circles overlapping in the middle and a third smaller circle overlapping only the top right part of the right circle. There are lots of illegible text on the board.

Cueball: Everything is named after Euler. Euler's constant, Euler's function. Cueball: Can't we let John Venn have this? Off-panel voice: No. Off-panel voice: Also, numbers are now \"Euler letters.\"\n","explanation":"In this comic, Cueball is showing a diagram titled \" Venn diagram \" he made about something to an unseen audience. An off-panel person informs Cueball that it is an Euler diagram , and starts to explain why, prompting Cueball to forestall the interruption and state that many things are named for Leonhard Euler (specifically Euler's constant and Euler's function apart from Euler diagram) and he just wants to call the diagram a Venn diagram to give John Venn a more equal share of the fame. His off-screen friend refuses, and mockingly states that numbers are now called \"Euler letters\".\nThis may be in response to the fact that Randall has made several comics about both Euler diagrams and Venn diagrams and has sometimes used the term Venn diagram for an Euler diagram, like in 2090: Feathered Dinosaur Venn Diagram . Maybe this was on purpose, as Cueball did here, or by mistake. In either case Randall has probably heard a lot from fans and friends when he made these comics, and thus this could be seen as a response.\nA Venn diagram is a widely used diagram style that shows the logical relation between sets.  It shows overlap of items in different categories (sets) by using overlapping circles (or other shapes) to stand in for categories. If an item is within a certain circle, it is in the category the circle represents. So in a Venn diagram of \"animals\" and \"furry things\", \"cat\" would be in the overlap between both circles, \"frog\" would be inside only \"animals\", and \"kiwifruit\" would only be in \"furry things\". \"Crystals\" would be outside both \ncircles.\nJohn Venn was not the first to invent the idea of drawing regions whose overlap shows the intersection of sets -- that was popularized by Euler (although he may not have been the first to do it) and was known as Euler Diagrams . Venn's innovation, roughly 100 years later, was to consistently draw ALL intersections of sets, even those intersections that had no members. In a Venn diagram, all 'circles' must overlap with all other circles, even if there are no items in the overlap. This is easy enough for 2 and 3 sets, but as the number of sets increases, the diagrams can get rather complicated . This and the relationships between the European countries are examples of this issue. The sets can start looking very non-circular. An Euler diagram is required to depict only the non-empty combinations\/sets, and therefore does not have this constraint. The diagram in the comic does not have any overlap between the left and right sections so, while it is an Euler diagram, it is not a Venn diagram.\nThe title text is an example of a \"written\" Venn diagram, with Leonhard Euler creating \" most of math \", both of them having created overlapping circle diagrams, and John Venn creating a cricket bowling machine. In his Wikipedia article it is stated that He built rare machines. A certain machine was meant to bowl cricket balls. See the title text drawn as a diagram in the inserted picture.\nOn a side note, if Euler letters were a thing, then they would be digits. And numbers would be Euler words!\n[Cueball is standing in front of a whiteboard with both arms raised holding his palms up towards and unseen audience.

The entry gives the definition of the word \"etymonline\" and makes it clear that this word has simply supplanted the word \" etymology \" in the intervening centuries.\nIt references the internet service known as Etymonline , or the Online Etymology Dictionary, and implies that Etymonline as a source became synonymous with the concept of etymology.\nThe caption to the comic states that it is ironic that the popularity of Etymonline eventually caused the loss of the word \"etymology\" from English. Perhaps Etymonline grew into such a comprehensive and reputable source that it deserved the all-encompassing identification with the concept of etymology (through metonymy ); or it simply gained such ubiquity and market dominance that it became, to all intents and purposes, the only service people used to meet their etymological needs and popular usage abandoned the original term in favor of the name for the tool associated with learning a word's origin.  All we know is that the brief etymology given in the entry cites \"modification\" of a more archaic English form (the one we are familiar with), without any mention of the digital resource. This is a mild failure on the part of the dictionary entry, since the suffix \"online\" should at least have been noted as the modifier resulting in the current form. Perhaps a discussion of the specific internet service was not relevant in the entry, or the very concept of \"online\" has been so superseded by whatever its successors or usurpers might have become that it was lost to common, or indeed academic, knowledge.\nThe entry about etymonline uses, as an example of the use of the word, a quote regarding the etymology (etymonline) for the word Blimp . This example is a quote from a book from the year 2384 called Jovian Blimps: a History , dating the definition entry as being from some time after that work was published. It also states that, by that year, the word blimp no longer refers to a kind of airship still used on Earth (at the actual time of this comic's release) but instead to \"Sky-cities\" floating in the atmosphere of Jupiter . Although it is still known that Blimp was once used for Earth airships, while presuming that the reader is overwhelmingly aware of the Jovian examples.\nThe title text plays with this (replacing \"etymologist\" with the derived term \"etymonlinguist\"). Following on from the fictional citation's assertion that the origin for those historic airships being called Blimps is unknown, we get a comment from some present-day scholar (directed to the author of the futuristic entry) clarifying what they know about the etymology of the word \"blimp\". It references two theories of the etymology: that it is simply onomatopoeia; or that it was constructed from the phrase \"Type B - Limp\". It rejects the latter as a folk etymology, i.e. a back-formation, consistent with the explanation on Wiktionary and the Etymology section on the Blimp article upon Wikipedia. It is interesting to note that the current Etymonline entry only lists the B-Limp origin and does not mention onomatopoeia at all, though it does at least acknowledge that the origin is \"obscure\".\nAlready, a day after the release of this comic, the words mentioned in here trended on Etymonline, see more in the trivia section below.\n[A picture of a dictionary definition that is askew in the frame to imply that it is printed or written on physical paper rather than a digital resource.]\netymonline (n) et\u30fby\u30fbmon\u30fbline \/,\u025bt.\u0259m\u0252n'lain\/ The history and derivation of a word.

For example, mine was published half an hour after the Big Bang.\n","explanation":"This comic shows figure 6.14 from a science text book, which displays The periodic table of the elements , but with only the first four elements ( hydrogen , helium , lithium and beryllium ) shown. Randall claims, in the caption, that you can use the layout of an included periodic table to date a publication based upon the elements present or missing. In this case, his book was somehow published just half an hour after the Big Bang , at which time those four elements were the only ones present. The joke here is that he has conflated elements being absent from the periodic table because they have not yet been discovered, with them being absent because they do not yet exist.\nFrom about 10 seconds until about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the phase that is known as the Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurred. At that time, hydrogen ions (single protons) provided for helium in abundance and traces of lithium. Some berylium-7 was also formed, which is an unstable isotope , and with a half life of 53 days, an appreciable amount of what had been created would still be there several months after the Big Bang, and certainly most of what was created would be there half an hour after.\nThe conclusion is that Randall's science book was published when those four elements were the only ones in existence, and before the point where practically all the beryllium had decayed. After that point, only the three first would be present, until star formation began and started the process of Stellar nucleosynthesis .\nOf course no life as we know it could exist until long after stellar nucleosynthesis had created all the other elements needed to support carbon-based life . And no life, as we could even imagine, would be able to exist for the first 370,000 years after Big Bang as atoms (in a form that could eventually form molecules) could not exist until the recombination phase of the universe, due to the high energy of cosmic background radiation . Carbon-based textbooks could not exist either.\nEven now, many elements do not occur naturally on Earth and have to be synthesized to be practically studied, or deduced from what was seen during their often short lives. Others were always very hard to detect, collect enough in pure form or purify enough to properly discover them. Until these elements were discovered, one way or another, they were not included in the periodic table. Various versions of the periodic table had left spaces for these expected elements , but these gaps have now all been filled, and all recent modifications have been either additions to the end of the prior version of the table or changes of the names given to recent additions.\nThe Periodic Table has been under continuous revision since its invention by Dimitri Mendeleev in 1869. As printed scientific textbooks do not update themselves after being published, [ citation needed ] dating a publication by its Periodic Table is therefore possible, though in order to make the attempt one would need to know when various elements were discovered, isolated and named; when the symbols for particular elements were adopted and changed; when various elements were moved to different Groups; and when the Periods used in the tables were revised due to advances in knowledge of atomic structure. Determining the age of the work by checking which elements are present could be done, but would be less accurate.\nThe title text refers to how yet-undiscovered elements are given a systematic element name as a temporary name, until a more permanent name is decided upon. The names are based upon a standard group of Greek and Latin roots (depicting the decimal digits used to 'spell out' an element's unique atomic number , i.e., the number of protons) and adding an \"\u2011ium\" at the end. The claim in the title text is that, in the textbook with the figure, researchers claim they have synthesized six additional elements in the second row, temporarily named 'pentium' (atomic number \"5\") through to 'unnilium' (\"one zero\", or \"10\"), just as element \"118\" was provisionally called \"ununoctium\". At the time of release of this comic, element 118 is currently the last confirmed element and has been officially called oganesson . The title text of 2639: Periodic Table Changes , the previous comic to draw a periodic table, also refers to this.\nElement number five is, in our time and reality, actually well known as boron . (Its 'provisional' name of Pentium was also used for a series of microprocessors launched by Intel in the 1990s.) \"Unnilium\", element number 10, is neon , a member of the group of noble gases , which (along with fellow group member helium) was discovered only at the very end of the 19th century. Despite helium being one of the first elements to exist, and still one of the most common in the universe (roughly 24%, by mass, with hydrogen being around 75% and every other element combined being the remainder), it did not appear in the earliest periodic tables. It was only first detected from afar, as a constituent of the Sun, about thirty years before it was finally physically discovered in an actual lab here on Earth. (This is likely because helium is both inert and light.) It is also possible that neon's provisional name in 'early science' might have been something more along the lines of \"decium\", all else being equal.\nSince life could not have existed at the time this book should have been published, the idea of researchers synthesizing elements, or indeed the existence of books or even researchers, is of course just part of the joke.\n[Subheading]: Figure 6.14 [Title]: The periodic table of the elements\n[The following four rectangles featuring the large element abbreviation, with the full element name written below, in a typical periodic table style] [Top row, far left]: H Hydrogen [Top row, far right, detached from any other box]: He Helium [Bottom row, attached directly below the \"H\" box]: Li Lithium [Bottom row, attached directly to the right of \"Li\"]: Be Beryllium\n[Caption below the panel]: You can spot an outdated science textbook by checking the bottom of the periodic table for missing elements.

He ponders as to the intended meaning behind the word \"Delicate\" and decides to look up detailed information on what the settings do and when to use them. A thought then occurs to him that there should be a location where people could crowd-source data on what settings they have found work best for various clothing items, before realizing that that would likely have already been done by the manufacturers beforehand and the results put into the product manual.\nLabels on appliances tend to be terse, often using single words that make the intended interpretation challenging. In this case Cueball likely is trying to wash something that is both \"delicate\" and has \"colors\", but is forced to choose between them, even though there would ideally be a washer setting that anticipates the need for both considerations at once. Due to the laconic vagueness in the choice of wording for the dial (or button\/menu), the \"(Light)\" may refer to the setting being intended for lightly or pastel colored clothing, that the setting is meant for delicate fabric, or that it is a quick, surface-level wash (i.e. as opposed to deep cleaning), though a separate \"half load\"\/\u201deconomy\" button (or similar) often exists that abbreviates the appropriate phases of each main washing cycle accordingly.\nThe title text proposes deliberately ignoring the manual for a dishwasher and continuing to use the internet and other people for information on household devices. This might refer to the tendency for people to not read manuals and instead post their queries online awaiting answers, which sometimes gets disparaging comments to read the manual . It also references Quora , a website which allows users to publicly ask questions and answer the questions of others. The website is not typically known for its debates, although the situation in this comic could probably lead to one, as it is quite opinion-dependent with no true correct answer (even the suggested settings given in the manual, written by the makers themselves, could be prone to disagreement as users might find the settings to have adverse effects on their clothing, or discover an even better setting that the makers might not have had). Although Quora moderation is notably inconsistent, being inflammatory (as people tend to be in debates that progress too long) could lead to one's account being reported and banned, like on a typical social network or forum.\n[Cueball is standing in front of a large combination washing machine\/dryer, holding a coat, wondering.] Cueball: Okay, do I want \"Colors (light)\" or \"Delicate\"?

As the cycle continues, the Sun returns to minimal activity and starts over. Without actually studying the Sun, however, there is no discernible difference to our daily lives here on Earth, and studying the Sun in enough detail is difficult due to its intrinsic and eye-damaging brightness whenever viewed directly. The comic may be a joke that nobody ever looks outside anymore, and so it may be possible to convince people that the sun has gone away. It's worth noting that the umbra (darkest portion) of a sunspot is still roughly 3000-4500K, so if the sun were to express as one massive umbra it would still be very visible, possibly appearing as a type K star.\nThis comic makes a joke that when the absolute number of sunspots appears to decrease it is not because they disappear, but because they get so crowded that they begin to merge, and thus the number of individual spots decreases whereas the area of the sun covered by sunspots continues to increase to near total 'darkness'. This causes there to be a completely dark Sun after 11 years, at which point any new sunspots are bright patches, and the next 11-year cycle repeats the process but accumulating bright spots until eventually it is all bright once more, giving a total bright\/dark cycle of 22 years.\nThe curve showing the number of differentiable sunspots covers a bit more than 11 years, one full cycle of our normal Sun. During that time the number of sunspots first increases and then decreases down to zero. At the end of this cycle our Sun has returned to its starting brightness. The comic's sun, however, has gone from fully bright to fully dark; its full cycle takes 22 years. The number of distinct spots (of either kind) first increases and then decreases as they merge into just one Sun-enveloping spot. Then the other type of spot appears and begins to dominate once more.\nBelow is a graph showing the number of sunspots as a function of time from around 1965 to 2025. Periods where the sun is dark are shown with black under the curve, and in transition periods with lines of darkness getting closer together on the way to 'fully' dark area plus vals of light reinserting themselves in the lightening part of the cycle. Also for clarity the troughs are labeled with the sun being bright or dark. It is always when there are few spots that the sun is either completely free from spots and thus bright, or completely covered and thus dark. The maxima are always during the height of the transition between the two extremes, with a wide swathe of the time around the minima being mostly light or mostly dark, alternating at around a decade of each predominating.\nAt times, this closely synchronizes with the calendar decades. From this curve it can be seen that the Sun was bright across the 1990s, but not in the dark 1980s or the dark time from around 2001 to 2014. This fact is mentioned in the title text (see below). Similarly the 1970s were mostly bright, after the largely dark 1960s, the width of the transition periods covering the marked decade-defining years in slightly offset ways compared to the neighboring ones. After the darkness began around 2000, the shift was such that it finally got bright again around 2014, with darkness returning around 2024. This is because of the sunspot cycles being 11 years (making the illumination cycle 22 years) and eventually it no longer credibly meshes with the arbitrary decadal cut-offs.\nAll this would obviously be catastrophic if it happened in our version of the universe, as during a dark phase insufficient light would be coming from the Sun, and the Earth could freeze if all the energy from the Sun was reduced. If the spots only affect light in the visible spectrum, then Earth would not freeze but plants would have trouble with photosynthesis and other natural processes would be interrupted. In our universe sunspots cool the area of the Sun where they appear, relative to the rest of the surface (50-75% of the nearly 6000K 'norm'), but they are far from being actually dark; NASA says that each sunspot on its own would glow orange, brighter than the full Moon. So even in a completely sunspot-covered Sun, the Sun would still be brighter than (with a typically bright Sun illuminating it) the Moon, and far brighter than the dark-time Moon would become (possibly causing issues for nocturnal life, as well). It would be possible to see it (and see by it) even if the heat delivered were very low and even noon would seem to be crepuscular by our normal expectations. See more in the title text explanation.\nThese problems are obviously not a serious threat in the reality of the comic, as the Sun is truly dark and yet people and natural systems have long survived these dark periods and adapted accordingly. This becomes clear in the title text where internet memes indicate that people lived fine through the dark periods, although they obviously did not 'properly' see the Sun as kids if they were born near the start of a 'dark decade'.\nThe title text indicates the effect on internet memes that the special solar cycle has had. During the 2010s in our universe there were many '90s kid' memes. Those were also popular in this universe, but they reflect that the Earth had at that time been dark since the 2000s, and thus only those born in the 90s and before would remember dawn or the feeling of the warm sun on their faces.\nThis of course indicates that the Sun is actually dark and gives no warmth. Thus it is a mystery how life on Earth prevails, but given that there were kids from the 1990s that made memes twenty years after, life does work in this strange alternate universe.\n[This comics shows two graphs, one also with several images of the Sun in different times in the solar cycle.

[Caption below panel] Researchers hate it when you do placebo controlled trials of their methodology.\n","explanation":"When testing the efficacy of a potential medical treatment, researchers compare subjects who received the treatment against subjects who received a placebo . Usually each subject does not know whether they received the treatment or placebo, and neither do the practitioners, until the end of the trial. This distinguishes the actual effects of the treatment from the effects of simply participating in a study. People who receive a placebo (or an ineffective treatment) often believe their treatment is working due to such causes as paying more attention to one's health or expecting to feel better. This misattribution of effect to a non-treatment is called the \"placebo effect\".\nIn this comic a team of researchers appears to have studied some medical treatment, using a placebo controlled test. They present their findings in which a particular subset of participants (out of at least four distinct groups) shows an apparently significant result. The graph shows that three groupings have results whose error-bars indicate that they might easily have zero (or neutral) true effects, if not negative ones. But, even at the lowest extent of the accepted uncertainty, the fourth stands out as definitively having some degree of positive effect (of whatever kind this particular graph is plotting).\nHowever, it is revealed that the 'treatment' they were given was also a placebo. Their own study was the subject of a placebo controlled test conducted on their methodology. They were the placebo group, while a different team presumably used the exact same methodology to study the real treatment. Thus, all of this team's findings were due to the placebo effect, or else the trial size and scope allowed a purely statistical 'blip' to occur, instead of there being any real merit to the \"treatment\". This indicates that their methodology shouldn't be used for any real world applications. This may be a subtle dig at the recent aducanumab Alzheimer's drug trial controversy, where post-hoc reanalysis of one subgroup of patients revealed a surprising result when the overall trial had otherwise failed.\nThe particular flaw in the methodology appears to be dividing too few subjects into too many sub-groups, allowing a chance cluster of anomalous results to overly influence an apparent result. The researcher did find significance in one sub-group, even though in reality there was no signal, just noise, since it was all placebo groups. This references the same p-hacking problem as 882: Significant . Only in this case the researcher themself is the subject of the real trial.\nIf the non-placebo study had the exact same size and design (as it should have, in such a meta-study), it would cast doubt upon whether any similar-looking findings in London were significant. Especially if they also found that the same subgroup were again exhibiting the sole significant effect, which might reveal an inbuilt flaw in the procedure. On the other hand, it could just further show how likely any particular grouping was to falsely show a result; if all groups had apparently benefited, the chances are that most of them were correct, whether or not 2268: Further Research is Needed .\nTreatments can be more effective on specific subgroups of the population; for example, an anti-cancer drug might only work against specific mutations that cause cancer. But any such result needs to have appropriate statistical significance and new subjects from that subgroup should be tested to ensure the result is repeated.\nThe title text points out how the experiment has almost certainly violated some set of ethical standards, because one researcher offers what he believes to be genuine treatment to a large number of participants only for a third party (the offscreen speaker) to replace all his medicine with placebos, ultimately deceiving the patients. The title text implies that it was approved by a genuine Institutional Review Board (IRB), the group which decides whether a proposed experiment is ethical to perform. However they also have a \"placebo IRB\", presumably made up of people who have no qualifications to make such judgements well, or perhaps not made up of people at all, but simply a mechanism for generating random decisions.\nHowever, such a methodology trial using all placebos wouldn't necessarily be unethical.  In addition to using a placebo, most studies are \"double blind\" meaning neither the patients nor the doctors\/nurses treating them know who is getting the placebo and who is not; only the researchers conducting the study know.  This is so doctors\/nurses cannot inadvertently let the patients know who is getting real medicine (by acting with remorse around patients they know are not being treated, or being more cheerful with patients they know who are).  It is considered perfectly ethical for doctors to give patients what they believe is medicine but is not (the placebo).  This is because without the double blind procedure it may not be possible to identify real medicines from ones that have no effect, and the impact of preventing real medicine from being used by millions is greater than the deceit towards the small number receiving a placebo in the experiment.  By extension it could be ethical to have the researcher conduct a trial with two placebos without knowing it.  For instance if the London team and the team in the comic were finding beneficial effects in new drugs that other researchers found had no effect (or finding other drugs didn't work when others had evidence they did) then it may be worth investigating if their shared methodology has the flaw demonstrated in the article.  That way regulatory agencies could exclude their flawed data when they make decisions on what drugs to approve, while the two teams could shift to a better methodology and return to contributing to medical science.\n[Cueball stands in front of a poster holding a pointer.

After the first season it gets really good. Cueball: Oh yeah, I've heard that! [Situation 2:] White Hat: You should keep watching! After the first 8 movies, they get really good. Cueball: Haha, what? I'm not going to sit through eight bad movies! [Caption below the panel:] It's weird how it's way more normal and socially acceptable to suggest someone spend 10-15 hours watching something when it's TV rather than movies.\n","explanation":"The comic presents two separate conversations, which boil down to the same premise and yet differing conclusions. In one, a particular TV show is being watched, in the other a film franchise.\nWhile it is finding its feet, a new season of a television show (perhaps commissioned, on the back of some perceived interest in the story it will tell, for a dozen or so episodes of around 50 minutes - i.e. about ten hours) is not necessarily going to get everything right in the writing style, the slant it puts on the subject matter, the cast of characters or other production values. Or at least not for mass appeal to the everyman, for whom Cueball is the archetypal representative. Nevertheless, many series do get further seasons and greatly improve. White Hat (the optimist, and clearly won over by the production) is on the way to successfully convincing Cueball to view a particular series, or perhaps to continue to watch it after becoming jaded by its early failure to live up to its hype. It sounds reasonable to Cueball, just from his friend's recommendation, to get over the hump and appreciate it \"when it gets good\".\nOn the other hand, many television shows achieve their highest popularity in their first season.  The first season is usually when unknown stars achieve their breakout and become popular, when mysteries and cliffhangers that capture the imagination are introduced, and when interesting plotlines that engender viewer interest develop (often which two members of a love triangle will fall for each other).  While the next few seasons are often considered the \"golden age\" of such series (as all of the interest is fresh, plot lines and mysteries are not yet resolved, and actors and writers are in their stride and not yet burned out) it is rare for a popular or well regarded TV series to have a first season that is considered bad.\nA series of films, however, is seemingly a different matter. By substituting 10+ hours of filmed-for-television with something more cinematic, the prospect of getting over the exact same scale of 'hump' in a long-running set of sequels (eight films at a not unreasonable average length of 85 minutes each would also require a bit more than ten hours of commitment), is not at all enticing.  However, since the average movie runs about 131 minutes, 10 hours of TV run time (about 15 episodes each with 40 minutes of show - the 40 minutes being the one hour time slot minus commercials) would only last the same as about four and a half movies, not eight.  TV shows on modern streaming services such as Netflix tend to be longer (55 minutes per episode) but also fewer episodes per season (10-13) and so are still only as long as four to five movies.  Watching four or so movies seems much less of a burden, many modern film franchises (among them the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars, Star Trek and the Harry Potter series) have successfully gone well beyond four films.\nThe real reasons for this difference are that:\nThe mention of \u201cafter the first 8 movies\u201d might be a reference to the long-running Fast and the Furious franchise, which now has 9 movies (plus a couple of spin-offs) at the time of this comic\u2019s publication. The more recent movies are well-reviewed (rated \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes), even though the first four were widely panned by critics. Someone like Randall, who may have ignored the franchise when it first came out in 2001, may be wondering if he should watch the more recent ones that critics generally like; and, if so, does he need to catch up on the initial movies first?\nThe title text talks of the long-running British TV series that is Doctor Who . The original Doctor Who, running from 1963-1989 was typically low budget, for its time and locality, though initially considered cutting edge in many ways. Compared to more modern classics, and especially Hollywood sci-fi, it would be noticeably not as good. The revived series (2005-present) has a much higher production budget and is typically much more aligned to modern viewers, who may willfully ignore or not even know of the older episodes. Someone just starting to watching Doctor Who sequentially from the very first season (broadcast in 1963) would have to watch hundreds of episodes (26 'seasons', by some counts) before the series \"gets good\" to modern eyes, if the \"good\" point is the 2005 series revival, or even quite a few to reach any given key point in the original run.  Thus Doctor Who is considered to be its own thing, and unlike other shows where the fans recommend you suffer through a poor first season to enjoy improvement in subsequent seasons, Whovians might recommend potential new fans to begin with the 2005 reboot (technically the 27th season), which was produced to appeal to all new-comers without even necessarily any cultural knowledge of what had been broadcast up until the long hiatus a decade and a half before.\nFurthermore, it is not uncommon to recommend that even within the 2005 reboot of Doctor who, that new viewers don't start at the beginning (season 1 or 27 if counting the original series), but instead start at season 5 (or 31 including the originals), when the Doctor regenerated to his 11th incarnation (due to higher budgets and production values by that point, and the start of a new story arc with new characters being introduced), and later on go back to watch the earlier seasons. [ actual citation needed ]\nThere is also the wrinkle that anyone wishing to start with the original run would be out of luck, seeing as many early episodes - before the late-70s - were lost forever . ( TV Tropes link ).\nThe BBC didn't see any value in keeping them as they couldn't rerun them, so random episodes would be disposed of or recycled for various reasons, and those episodes are gone, making many stories incomplete. Some have been recovered because fans recorded them, or because tapes were sent to overseas stations for rebroadcast and never discarded (in fact, the audio for every single episode has been preserved) but most lost episodes remain lost.\nIt is vague about Randall's precise opinion, but even the most dedicated fan would acknowledge that it has had a varying quality\/charm\/consistency\/etc, according to one's personal tastes for such things. Comparing the original run (pre-Millenium, featuring seven key actors sequentially taking on the title role over more than four decades, and another for a standalone TV-movie) with the revived series (continuing the pattern with a similar number of additional title-actors in just half the time), and any number of 'show-runners' (producers, main writers, etc) is one possible point of contention, probably more suited to British viewers. Possibly, in Randall's case, it is just the (perceived) ups and downs in the more recent era, which has been more consistently screened in the US.\n[Two situations are depicted between White Hat and Cueball.] [Situation 1:] White Hat: You should keep watching!

This results in all these lanes to end near the right edge of the road. Every time the lane gets too near the edge the lane lines stop and on the end of the lane there is a curving arrow pointing left. Below the arrows the word \"Merge\" is written. This happens seven times on this small patch of highway. At the bottom and top there are the lane marker lines entering and exiting, so there are always four lanes.

Like in 253: Highway Engineer Pranks , Randall proposes an ineffective highway design, which reportedly got him fired.\nHighways normally have several, but not a fixed number of lanes; more lanes may be included on parts of the highway with higher traffic flow, and the design decision can interact with entrances and exits to the highway. One common structure is to merge a lane from the right to the left after an entrance, to remove the extra lane created by the merge of the entry ramp. Drivers are expected to merge into one of the lanes further left before the lane on the right ends.\nHere, Randall has designed a highway where the lanes are not aligned to the road, thus constantly expanding to the left and requiring merges from the right. This is highly impractical, as each individual lane merge is a difficult maneuver compared to normal driving; being forced to perform these near-constantly is a large hindrance at the least and a large danger at the most.\nEffectively every car would have to drive with their left turn blinker on constantly in order to drive in a regular straight line. Alternatively cars could stage their lane changes which would make them swerve gently back and forth across the road. Since everyone will choose a different strategy, the road would be chaos. People would almost never try to make a right lane change since lanes to the right end sooner.\nWhile considerably less extreme, a section of U.S. 101 \"North\" (which is actually traveling west) in California is somewhat like this.  The road is four lanes when crossing over I-405, with an additional lane immediately entering on the right from I-405 South, but three of these lanes become exit only lanes in the San Fernado Valley (at Haskell Avenue, Havenhurst Avenue, and Topanga Canyon Blvd) and two in Ventura County (one in Thousand Oaks and one in Ventura), so all through traffic must merge into the two lanes that enter on the left carrying traffic from I-405 North.\nThe title text refers to local magnetic declination , the angle between the magnetic north pole and the true (geographic) north pole. Magnetic declination varies over time due to polar wandering and so the lane markers on the highway would need to be regularly updated to account for this.\n[In a white panel a black road starts at the bottom left and curves gently towards the right until the middle of the panel, where it begins curving slightly to the left ending in the top right corner. The road has space for four lanes divided by lane markers, but the markers does not follow the direction of the road but goes more from left to right than the road, even though they do follow the general curve of the road, but never the actual direction of the road.

The frozen margarita variety is blended with ice, and this comic suggests making an enormous drink using the ice from a comet nucleus \u2013 the one depicted having more than a passing similarity to the much studied 67P\/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko . Based on the amount of ice in a typical comet, it extrapolates the quantity of the other ingredients. The mixed drink is big enough to fill Lake Mead , a massive reservoir on the Colorado River created by the water held by the Hoover Dam .\nBeyond the unusual quantities and mixing method, Randall uses the general term \"orange liqueur\" here rather than specifying triple sec. Assuming that each oil tanker holds exactly the same amount of liquid, the tequila:triple sec ratio in the comic is 4:1, meaning more tequila is used than necessary (the ratio should be 5:2).\nArmageddon is a movie starring Bruce Willis about a team of astronauts and oil drill engineers on a mission to blow up an asteroid that's on a collision course with the Earth.

The comic suggests using the same technique to explode the comet nucleus to get the ice. It should be noted that consuming any cocktail which has been infused with the radioactive byproducts commonly resulting from the detonation of a thermonuclear weapon may pose health risks which exceed those typically associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages in general.

Here the cocktail is served from the drained basin of Lake Mead, which has rock as a substrate - hence \"on the rocks.\" In addition the comet nucleus contains lots of rocky material, so \"on the rocks\" with Randall's planet killer cocktail would also be served with literal rocks in it.\nIn the header, it says \"Today's comic was drawn for Daniel Becker, based on his winning question submitted to the What If? 2 contest.\" As explained in the What If? entry melting a comet on Earth has enough negative effects on the climate to negate the cooling effect a couple thousand times over \u2013 thus this margarita may in fact proudly wear the title \"planet killer\".\nAssuming an average oil tanker size of 25.8 million gallons, this provides approximately 1,700 servings of tequila per adult on the planet.  Therefore it is a planet killer in terms of alcohol poisoning and killing off all humans of adult drinking age.\nThe Planet Killer Comet Ice Margarita\nIngredients 4,000 oil tankers full of tequila 1,000 tankers full of orange liqueur 1,000 tankers full of agave The juice from 20 trillion limes One comet nucleus\nInstructions (1) Drain Lake Mead, combine ingredients behind Hoover Dam (2) Detonate comet using Bruce Willis's drilling rig from Armageddon (1998) Boom (3) Dispense drink through Hoover Dam turbines\n"}

She addresses an unseen audience in front of the podium.] Ponytail: Our analysis shows that there are three kinds of people in the world: Ponytail: Those who use k -means clustering with k=3, and two other types whose qualitative interpretation is unclear.\n","explanation":"Ponytail is giving a talk about her research groups analysis of which different types of people there are in the world.\nA popular class of wry observations use the snowclone \"There are two types of people in the world... those who do A, and those who do B\". Here B will usually, though not always, be some antithesis of A. The most self-referent version is the joke \"There are two types of people in the world - those who divide people into two types, and those who don't\". Other well known versions include: \"There are three types of people in the world - those who can count, and those who can't\", \"There are two types of people in the world - those who can extrapolate... \", and \"There are 10 types of people in the world - those who understand binary and those who don't.\"\nPonytail uses k -means clustering with k=3. This is a method of categorizing data. To explain how it works, imagine a set of people of various heights and weights, that should be split into 3 groups (which gives k the value 3). One way to do this would be to plot the data onto a scatter chart; then pick three points at random for reference; then sort the people according to which point they are closest to, forming 3 initial groups. After forming 3 groups, the average of the data point of every item in each group is found; these average data points are used as new reference points to once again categorize all the data into 3 new groups. This process is repeated until the data converges; that is, the data points no longer change groups even after new reference points are picked.\nThe k -means algorithm is quite simple, which lends to its popularity, but it has a major drawback: the analyst has to determine how many groups (or clusters) to split the data into (that is, what to set k equal to). A value of k that doesn't match the underlying structure of data can yield a partitioning that's hard to explain in terms of properties that distinguish each cluster (in other words, their qualitative interpretation is unclear).\nPonytail's determination that there are three clusters is unsurprising if she herself falls into the category of those who use k=3 as a fixed value, which will inevitably result in three data clusters. However, the joke is that while one group's trait is \"uses K=3\", this logically means all the data that isn't in the group does not use k=3... except that with two other groups, then that description applies to both, meaning what distinguishes the other two groups from each other is unclear.\nThis could though easily have been fixed by saying those who use k-means clustering with k=3, those who use k<3 and those who use k>3. So splitting the rest up in just two groups would seem to be no problem... except for accounting for those who do not have a preconceived value of k at all! (Ideally, one perhaps finds the lowest practical k having the least amount of total scatter away from any cluster's focus, for which there are various competing solutions according to the details of the analysis.)\nIn the title text Ponytail, or maybe it is Randall , claims that: \"According to my especially unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm, there are currently about 8 billion types of people in the world.\"\nThis seems to be Randall saying that every human is unique and cannot be meaningfully clustered together in groups. The human population passed 8 billion on 2022-11-15 two and a half months before this comic came out.\nThe title text uses the K-means algorithm with an absurdly exaggerated variant of this problem. If the number of clusters is equal to the number of data points, each point will be assigned to a separate cluster for which there is an exact match; in other words, each member is the sole member of its own group. With such parameters, it makes it impossible to meaningfully comment on similarities between any two members. This is humorous because it would make the result useless for the purposes for which clustering algorithms are typically used, such as making insurance risk pools or targets of advertisement campaigns. In assessing whether k or k\u00b11 clusters are more useful to describe data, a weighting related to the number of clusters, or the numbers of points per cluster, might encourage identical clusters (for exactly coincident member points) to be merged, as it should for near-identical source data such that it sufficiently embraces clustering - yet Randall's unconstrained algorithm seems to have no such metric and stops at the 'perfect' initial assumption where k\u2261n .\nInterestingly, by including the entire human population, the algorithm should be immune to bias in creating its input data. However, if every human is unique as Randall's algorithm claims, the only way to have the clusters converge is to \"throw out\" some traits of humans as unimportant. This may be objectionable to humans who disagree with that assessment. In contrast, in a supervised algorithm, the training data is tagged with traits that the trainers seek. These traits could be applied in a manner that is socially unacceptable, and lead to AI behavior that reflects the biases of the trainers.\n[Ponytail is standing on a podium pointing a stick towards a poster hanging behind her.

Hieronymus Fabricius: Wheee\n","explanation":"The Bursa of Fabricius is an organ found in birds that is necessary for the development of their immune systems.\nThis comic claims that the 16th century anatomist Hieronymus Fabricius (for whom the organ was named) had that organ and therefore was able to fly like a bird. However, despite being found only in birds, this organ does not in fact contribute directly to flight. Also, given that it only exists in birds, it is doubtful that Fabricius also independently had this same anatomical feature.\nMany scientific and mathematical discoveries, including anatomical structures, are named after the people who discovered or described them. For example, the islets of Langerhans were discovered by Paul Langerhans. Likewise, rare diseases are often named for the doctor who first describes the disease to the medical community, or for a researcher who identifies the specifics involved. They may attempt to set their own name to it, for posterity, or they are later honored in this manner by those who recognize their vital contribution to the field, such as with Parkinson's disease .\nIn other cases, rare diseases are named for the first or most famous (possibly even the only) person known to have had the disease. For instance ALS is commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease in the US because of baseball player Lou Gehrig having notably developed the condition. Outside of the US, it may be more known just as \"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\" (alternatively \"motor neurone disease\") or, for simplicity, the initials ALS (or MND).\nThe title text continues with the idea from the comic claiming that anatomical structures are solely possessed by the human for which they are named, in another similar example. Pierre Paul Broca , a French physician, anatomist and anthropologist, was known for his research on what is now known as Broca's area , a region of the brain used for speech and language processing. The premise being that, having this feature, he was uniquely gifted with the special ability to created powerful magnetic fields, enabling him to do fMRI research in the 19th century.\nBroca did not [ citation needed ] do fMRI research, a powerful method of non-intrusively imaging and analyzing the internal structures of the living human body (amongst other things), as it was not invented in his lifetime. Nor is it likely that this ability could be 'naturally' possessed by any individual, such as he. He did, however, physically study brains of known speech-impaired patients who had then subsequently died, determining what damage (in the area of the brain which was then to be named for him) was directly related to their specific group of ailments. Today, we can safely view this area in living people, using fMRI, and directly connect what we see with the current condition of patients. This increases our knowledge of the brain, as with the mythical abilities Randall gave Broca, but also possibly even allows us to help those currently under the effects of any observed damage (not necessarily possible by any 19th century physician, even with this superpowered form of vision to assist them).\nIn reality, if Broca was the only person to have ever possessed Broca's area then this might have meant that only he had ever had the power of speech (as we understand it), which would indeed give him a very special ability; but one begging a number of other vital questions, if only anybody else could have asked them...\nThis may also be a nod to the Discworld character \"Bursar\" , a wizard at Unseen University who can fly because he once hallucinated that he could, and so now he can.\n[An almost bald man with hair around the neck and a full beard, is shown flying in the top right part of the image, swooping down from the sky with arms outstretched in front of him while yelling.

Ponytail: Wow! Ponytail: ...Wait.\n[Caption below the panel:] My hobby: Unhelpful size comparisons\n","explanation":"Another comic in the My Hobby series.\nCueball attempts to emphasize to Ponytail the size of Texas (the largest state in the contiguous United States , and the second largest US state overall), by making a size comparison. He states that with Texas expanded to the size of the Solar System , the ants in Texas will be as large as Rhode Island (the smallest US state). However, Cueball on purpose (according to the caption) just proves how small Texas actually is compared to the Solar System (which is a lot larger). [ citation needed ] Additionally, the deeper truth of the original statement is inverted; if a much smaller state (Rhode Island, Delaware, etc.) were scaled up to the size of the solar system, its ants would be the size of Texas itself, over 200 times as large as the scaled up Texan ants, so the relative smallness of the Texan ants shows how big Texas is.\nA common analogy for expressing a statistic (such as area\/volume\/population size\/population density) of unfamiliar things is to compare that thing to some other reference that people are likely to already have an understanding of, if only through past comparisons. For instance, it is said that a human-sized flea could jump the equivalent height of the Eiffel Tower (if jumping ability scaled with animal size; which it does not, due to how some of the different numbers involved will scale to the square or cube of the linear factor, so such aspects as power-to-weight ratios and sheer biomechanical strengths cannot be maintained). In this case, Randall is comparing objects that are extremely different in scale (the state of Texas and a small insect), but then blowing Texas up to yet another size many orders of magnitude larger, and then comparing it with something else his addressee has no comprehension of, with the result that the comparison is of no value in understanding how big Texas is (which could be supposed to be Cueball's intended impartation), or what ants have to do with anything in the first place. The only message you get in the end is that \"Texas is much bigger than an ant!\"...\nThere are a lot of definitions for how large the Solar System is, but one that is used (and easily agreed upon) is based upon Neptune 's aphelion (the farthest point from Sun of the outermost planet). Using the circle area equation , we might say that the 'area' of the solar system is 6.49\u00d710 19 square kilometers (2.506\u00d710 19 square miles), which is a lot, with Texas's area being in turn measured as 696,241 km\u00b2 (268,820 mi\u00b2). The difference in size is the huge factor of 9.32\u00d710 13 (not a simple number ). Ants, unfortunately for the calculations, vary vastly in size, but Rhode Island's area is known to be 3,144 km\u00b2 (1,214 mi\u00b2). We can therefore back-calculate that Randall's average \"ant\" would occupy 33.73 square millimeters. Roughly measured, an ant has an \"aspect ratio\" of 1:2 (width to length), and such an assumption leads to a length of 8.21mm, which falls easily into the range of 2\u201325mm for various possible species and types of ants. Therefore, Randall's calculated comparison indeed holds up as valid.\nThe title text refers to the opposite, with the entire Solar system being scaled down to the size of Texas. Houston (a city in Texas) has a metropolitan area (an area extending a bit beyond the city itself) that, if shrunk by the same factor as before, would be smaller than a grasshopper in Dallas , another city in Texas. (This, of course, only works if Houston's environs are part of what is shrunk, yet the grasshopper \u2013 and perhaps at least part of its apparent hometown of Dallas \u2013 remains unchanged.) The calculations to verify this hinge upon Houston's metro area normally being considered to be 26,061 km\u00b2 (10,062 mi\u00b2), and hence becoming 279.6 square millimeters. A grasshopper may be considered thinner than an ant, so we shall use the aspect ratio of 1:3 instead, to give a length of 28.96 mm, or almost 3 centimeters and approximately an inch. This falls within the range of 1\u20137cm range, that may be found quoted in some places , but is significantly smaller than notably large species . Whether the Dallas grasshopper is any particular variety (or even a native, rather than an exotic pet) is not expounded upon.\nOn the other hand, the comparison would be meaningful the other way around: \"The Solar System is so big that if you shrink it to the size of Texas, (the shrunken) Rhode Island would now be as small as (unshrunken) ants\".\n[Cueball speaking to Ponytail.] Cueball: Texas is so big that if you expanded it to the size of the Solar System, the ants there would be as big as Rhode Island.

Off-panel voice 2: And protons are red, right? Off-panel voice 3: What? No! They're gray!\n","explanation":"In this comic Miss Lenhart is teaching a school physics class. One of her students asks what the color of electrons is.\nThis is a relevant question for a kid to ask since on many scientific diagrams of atoms, the subatomic particles have been assigned colors to identify them for the reader. Neutrons are generally red, green, or gray; protons red or green and electrons might be blue or yellow. But there is no accepted rule for coloring such diagrams, so the kid may be confused. Additionally, some scientific diagrams use color coding rather than actually representative colors, and the kid may be wondering what color particles actually are.\nIn completely off-character style, Miss Lenhart actually gives a correct fact ...so \"color\" isn't even defined for them. and states that, unlike the diagrams, which are colored for convenience, the particles are not colored. She however gives a bogus, pseudoscientific explanation: They're too small to interact with visible light, ... In fact, every optical effect in our world is due to electrons interacting with light. That leads to colour because the electrons are usually bound to various atomic nuclei in molecules etc., which leads to differences in how they take up and give out various energies of photon. But the electron itself does not have a particular hue that can be shone upon and absorbed\/reflected, it merely governs the possible quanta of energy changes involved in generating the broad spectrum of light that the substance formed of the atom(s) may be seen by. Also protons are far \"bigger\" than electrons (and would interact strongly!), but their interaction with light (and generally electromagnetic radiation) is rarely observable, because they are shielded by the tiny electrons in ordinary matter. So, whether intended or not, Miss Lenhart is in her usual role of talking bullshit, also see for instance 1519: Venus .\nShe then continues by saying that electrons are definitely yellow. The reason for this isn't clear.  She may be:\nBut her off-panel pupils take her word for it. One of the kids says \"I knew it\", to the \"fact\" that electrons are yellow, and likewise the other pupils completely ignore what Miss Lenhart just told them. The debate then starts as one pupil claims and protons are red? , and another chimes in, with a No, they're gray! This only makes sense in a debate of how to draw atoms, not regarding their actual color, as Miss Lenhart just explained.\nThe opinions over the colors are probably based on what kind of diagrams people were initially exposed to, leading to a predisposition to think that those colors are 'correct'.\nAlthough individual electrons do not have a color, it's possible to produce a solution of so-called 'solvated' electrons . In ammonia and amines, in certain concentrations, the solution color is blue, and in higher concentrations metallic gold to bronze.\nThe title text refers to the color charge property of quarks, a property which is part of quantum chromodynamics . In quantum chromodynamics, a quark's color can take one of three values or charges: red, green, and blue. An antiquark can take one of three anticolors: called antired, antigreen, and antiblue. As mentioned by Randall , these have nothing to do with color as we know it, but is just a way to represent interactions between quarks in a sufficiently analogous fashion that avoids inventing entirely new words to describe a particular threefold quality of the necessary inter-quark groupings . And he jokingly says that the 20th century physicists that came up with the three color system did this as as admission that numbers are boring. They could just have called the color charges \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\", though this may imply an unwarranted hierarchy, progression or other standard mathematical relationship that does not actually apply.\n[Miss Lenhart is teaching a class.

It also has similarities to that of a Notice to mariners or air missions , where nautical or aeronautical navigation might be impinged by an area (or volume) that should be kept clear from in the near future, and to notices from websites or software providers about planned maintenance, which alert users about upcoming outages. Specifically, this notice advises those who are using the coordinate plane to avoid drawing any graphs in the area with a hole until the damage is patched or fixed.\nThe joke may have been inspired as a response to the 2023 China balloon incident , which occurred a few days earlier. This had occasioned one of the largest temporary flight restrictions, with a closed airspace as a response, in U.S. history.\nCoordinate planes are used in math for drawing graphs. The joke here is that a small section has been \"closed for maintenance,\" likening the concept of a coordinate plane to an actual physical platform used by math, which is therefore vulnerable to damage such as is shown in the comic. In reality, the coordinate plane cannot be damaged as it is not a tangible thing. [ citation needed ]\nClosure in mathematics can be a term relating to sets, specifically operations on sets, and a coordinate plane is a particular set of numbers.  A set is closed under an operation if all the \"answers\" to the operation are also in the set.  The coordinate plane is said to be closed under vector addition for example - adding together any two coordinates produces another coordinate in the plane.  Many functions and operators may be said to have closure on the real plane, and this comic may be a pun on that term. However, if there actually is a hole in the plane, then suddenly the plane will no longer exhibit closure.\nAlso related to closure is the closure problem . Put simply, the closure problem is to find the highest or lowest weight of a closure in certain types of graphs. This comic may also be talking about the closure problem, as it talks about a hole in the graph, and to minimise it would be referring to the closure problem.\nClosure can also be used in another sense, relating to the topology of a set; roughly speaking, a description of what parts of the set are \"close\" to others. In this sense, if one takes the closure of a plane with a hole, the result is indeed an intact plane, provided the hole is sufficiently (infinitesimally) small.\nThe title text notes that 3D graphs that cross the relevant x and y coordinates, but with non-zero z coordinates whilst in that zone, should be fine, since the hole only exists in the plane where z = 0. However, if they pass close - i.e. the z coordinate is small in this region - they should be wary of two dimensional graph lines suddenly becoming three-dimensional and interfering with them. This could be because they have intentionally entered three-dimensional space to avoid the closure, or possibly they have inadvertently been 'launched' above\/below the plane by the torn and warped edges of the surface. Or they simply fell into the hole, thus entering 3D space. This is similar to warnings to road traffic in open lanes being warned of traffic merging from lanes that have been closed due to works or any other general warning of increased congestion upon a parallel route used as a diversion.\nThe concept of 2D objects suddenly entering 3D space \u2014 in a way that creates interesting drama and conflict \u2014 is the subject of a book, Flatland, that Randall is familiar with, as it was the subject of 721: Flatland .\n[A coordinate graph is shown with both axes unlabeled but with two labeled ticks.

There is a caption beneath the panel:] Instead of serif or sans-serif, my new font is only serifs.\n","explanation":"This is a play upon the main difference between serif and sans-serif fonts. Serifs are ticks, or end-bars, at the ends of lines that make up letters, commonly used in most books and newspapers and also seen in calligraphic lettering (written with a flat-nibbed pen) and signwriting (often painted and detailed with fine brushes). Rather than mere lines, there are (for example) \"feet\" put at the bottom of a letter such as A , and possibly also at angles such as its peak. (In the comic, the first three elements appear to be of such an \"A\", with the text as a whole appearing to be \" Aa Bb Cc Dd \"). Fonts that use this visual decoration are called \"Serif\" fonts, while others do not and are thus \"Sans Serif\" fonts (\"sans\" being French for \"without\"). Randall is suggesting a font using only these accent pieces and skipping the \"body\" of the letters entirely. Of course, this renders the text basically unreadable, or at least you need good imagination and code breaking skills.\nAs for the title text, Times New Roman is a widely available and recognized typeface with serifs, being one of the most commonly used fonts of its type. Comic Sans is a mostly sans-serif typeface (hence the \u201cSans\u201d in the name) designed to look like (non- cursive , or block -style) handwriting, more akin to a basic and unadorned lettering written freehand by thick-nibbed pen, paintbrush, spraycan or chalk\/marker upon a blackboard\/whiteboard. Many graphic designers dislike Comic Sans due to a history of amateurs using it in contexts where its informal style is inappropriate, simply in order to vary the font away from the standards of Times or Arial styles (two major serifed and non-serifed families of font, respectively). Defenders claim that it is easier for dyslexics to read, and that it works well in less formal, typically children's contexts. Randall is suggesting here that if you want to severely anger a bunch of graphic designers (i.e. enough to beat you up), then you should try removing the characteristic and aesthetic serifs on Times New Roman and add them instead to the hated Comic Sans \u2013 which would probably make it look even worse to a graphic designer.\nOne of the users of Explain xkcd took the chance anyway of getting that beating and here is what it looks like normally and what it might look like after moving the serifs:\nRandall has had numerous careers and hobbies where he has delighted in exploring novel methods of resolving disputes, all of which has satisfied nobody and led to him being banned from numerous events .\nThe font is probably one of the many variants of Caslon , with its variety of A-serifs; some variants (3, 540) having the double-seriffed C.\n[A very thin comic panel with three light gray horizontal lines drawn as on ruled paper used for handwriting.

An anemometer is a device often found in such stations that measures wind speed and direction. The anemometer shown in the comic is a typical three-cup anemometer, whose spin rate is proportional to the wind speed. Thus spinning the cups quickly by hand can create an impression of fast winds and thereby excite any computers that happen to be monitoring the data and enjoy extreme weather.\nCombining the speed of winds in a F1 tornado (73~112 mph; 117~180 km\/h) and the speed ratio of typical three-cup anemometers (1\/2~1\/3) gives a cup speed of ~16m\/s, comparing the diameter of the anemometer to that of Cueball's arm gives an upper estimate of 0.5 meters (~two feet), topping out at roughly 10 turns per second , which is within a reasonable range for a human [ actual citation needed ] .\nThe title text continues the trend of messing with weather equipment, this time by messing with rain gauges . \" Pouring one out \" usually refers to the act of pouring a liquid, usually alcohol, on the ground as a symbol of reverence for a deceased friend or relative. Thus Cueball is mourning the now destroyed (aka \"deceased\") integrity of the precipitation data by pouring a glass of liquid into the gauge. However, it is this very act that ruined the integrity of the data.\n[Cueball is standing halfway up a stepladder, with his back to the ladder, on the top of a building.

According to legend, when Alexander the Great was faced with the knot, he simply drew his sword and cut it in half, thereby \"untying\" it and solving the unsolvable. The Gordian Knot is now used as a linguistic metaphor to describe a problem whose solution, rather than being to directly solve it head-on, involves working around or otherwise bypassing its apparent constraints, or simply one that is so complex as to be practically intractable.\nThe Ashley Book of Knots is an encyclopedia describing thousands of different knots. Though it is now dated, because it was written before the widespread adoption of synthetic fiber rope, it is still considered the reference in knot tying. Using all bends from the book and as many hitches would make the final result very complex indeed. Randall proposes here that this was the true origin of the mythical Gordian Knot. A \"hitch\" is a knot that connects a rope or line to something like a post, loop, or shackle.\nIn practice, it is not recommended to use overly complex knots, as they provide little in terms of additional security compared to a simpler, well-chosen knot. The ease of tying and untying, especially in less than ideal conditions, is also an important factor to consider. If strength is more important than the ease of tying and untying, splices should be considered instead of knots, as they don't weaken the rope as much.\nTwitter user HollowGrin created and shared a colorized version to aid tracking the ropes.\n[Two ropes tied together with several different kinds of knots.

This means that it goes, at the extremes, from having so little information as to make it effectively meaningless, to having significant extra information included (eventually making the original actually an unnecessary distraction). Some of this extra information mitigates the risk of another sense of 'loss' in data - digital data are transferred in bits, and data loss is the process by which some of these bits are lost or altered during data transport. However the highest quality, \"better data\", is using a different sense of the term \"quality\", referring more to the general excellence of the data than how accurately it represents the original.\nThe title text uses your cat as an example of this range of losses (or, in the case of the latter reaches of the graph, gains) in the information. This is possibly a reference to Norbert Wiener 's quote, \"The best material model of a cat is another, or preferably the same, cat.\" The most lossy is an exclamation about how cute your cat is, which is ephemeral and obviously carries very little significance in terms of actually providing specific, transferable information about your cat. The example then progresses into your cat's chip ID; presumably your cat has been microchipped, and between the last four digits (commonly used in sensitive information as an identifier without revealing the full number) or the entire chip ID, provides a still-uninformative yet slightly improved way of identifying your cat. A drawing of your cat and a photo of your cat would portray the cat reasonably well, while a clone of your cat and (of course) your actual cat would be the best way of gaining information about your cat. However, as in the actual comic, the final, most lossless (in this case, with the most gain) form of data transfer has nothing to do with your cat, but is simply Randall's better cat. This is apparently made out by Randall to be the pinnacle of cat data.\n[A line chart is shown with eight unevenly-spaced ticks each one with a label beneath the line.

The goal is to find the smallest possible \"outer square\" that will fit N \"inner squares\" that are each 1 unit wide and 1 unit tall. In the comic N=11, leading to its name of \"The N=11 Square Packing Problem,\" and the value 's' is the length of the outer square's sides. (For example, with 16 squares arrayed in a 4x4 square, 's' would be 4. [ an image would be helpful here ] )\nThis comic spoofs a common phenomenon for some values of N: sometimes the optimal solution looks very \"sloppy\" to human sensibilities. The lack of a uniform grid or pattern, where some squares look to be misaligned or a lot of space looks wasted, counterintuitively leads to a smaller value for 's' than something more \"organized\" might be. 'N=11' is one such \"frustrating\" solution (though it should be noted, the solution depicted has not yet been proven to be optimum).\nA few days before this comic's post, a web page Squares in squares gained interest on social media platforms such as Twitter and Hacker News . For many values of N, that page depicts the best known solutions, some of them known to be optimum. The one for N=11 (best known but not proven to be optimum) is the one Randall uses for this comic; its general arrangement was found by Walter Trump in 1979 and slightly improved by Gensane et al. in 2004. [1]\nMunroe claims to have found a more efficient solution for this N=11 case, by physically deforming the squares involved in the best-known solution with a hydraulic press . The size of the resulting bounding square is indeed smaller, but the \"solution\" isn't actually one because the inner shapes have countless wrinkles and are no longer squares. Geometrical shapes in packing problems are not conventionally assumed to be deformable in this manner. [ citation needed ]\nThe title text mentions the same approach \"improved\" the solution for 1 unit square, whose optimum solution is obviously that unit square itself with s=1. Munroe remarks that if he had \"some upgrades\", presumably a more powerful hydraulic press, he could get the resulting square to be even smaller.\nThe humorous implication behind the comic and the title text is that rather than the shapes being mathematical, abstract shapes, they are actually physical squares, constructed of some extremely strong, but not completely incompressible material. It is not obvious what material that might be: even using a hydraulic press, its cross-sectional area can only be reduced to 92-94% of its original size. (The fact that the theoretical squares exist in a 2D universe in the problem statement, but here are seemingly 3D objects showing distortions in the sides facing the viewer after being presumably crushed from the top and sides in turn by the hydraulic press, is not more fully addressed.)\nThis is perhaps a related joke to 2706: Bendy , but now with squares and compressed areas instead of triangles and extended lengths.  Unsolved packing problems also appear to be a long-standing interest of Randall, who shows himself pondering \"the most efficient packing of round-cut diamonds of uniform size\" in the What If? Expensive Shoebox , with the title text \"A Google search for unsolved+packing+problems very nearly got me just now.\"\n[11 squares are optimally packed inside a square arrangement.

I want to get what's coming to me. Genie: Listen, I'm just gonna give you $20 and call this even.\n","explanation":"In this comic Black Hat has found a lamp with a magical genie inside. This genie will only fulfill one wish (not the standard three) and warns that it will twist the wish to teach him a lesson...\nIn stories where wishing can come true by magical means, a common clich\u00e9 is that the wisher will make a wish (for greater or lesser personal gain) but the entity who grants it will inadvertently (or 'inadvertently' ) fulfill the exact wording in such a way that something bad happens which the wisher clearly did not foresee. This may teach the wisher, or at least the reader of the story, an important moral lesson against greed. The wish-granter is not always represented as deliberately obtuse or malicious, but may merely be a naive and uncritical servant of the wish-granting process. A wish for money, for example, might be 'easiest' to accomplish by suddenly being the recipient of a loved-one's Life Insurance rather than the rather less upsetting scenario of finding that they possess a winning lottery ticket. In the comic, however, this genie is perfectly self-aware of the part he will play in creatively misapplying the wish, and even goes so far as to forewarn the wisher \u2013 maybe a deliberate ploy to have wishers take a moment to think and tone down their more spontaneous demands.\nHowever, as is characteristic for him, Black Hat has no concern for the wider negative effects, and immediately wishes for rain to no longer happen, perpetually, for the apparent trivial reason of merely saving him the need to carry an umbrella. The consequences of this drastic change to the weather (no matter by which method it is accomplished) would plainly be very bad, as Black Hat is almost certainly fully aware. The genie realizes that there is very little 'good' idea for him to twist into a bad one, and that Black Hat will be peculiarly unreceptive to being 'taught a moral lesson'. Especially compared to the utter devastation that the granted wish will cause to the rest of the non-wishing world, which the genie might be reluctant to enact.\nHaving persuaded his wisher to retract the original request, the genie now has to deal with two rather too open-ended, generally pessimistic requests in a similar vein. Exactly what Black Hat \"deserves\" is possibly subjective; and someone \"getting what they deserve\" tends to be a rather negative outcome. To this, the genie seems dismayed at Black Hat essentially wishing for a bad outcome (with nothing to twist to serve a moral lesson), but the genie still seems to have enough latent sympathy to lampshade the trouble being invited, assuming that it was a particularly unintended turn of phrase.\nUndaunted, the next version of Black Hat's revised wish uses even more unambiguously perilous wording. The suggestion of \"what's coming to\" someone is frequently used as a threat (or menacing promise) of violence. Even taken at face value, the wish would either be meaningless (Black Hat would receive whatever fate would have befallen him without the wish, and the genie would have effected no change), or it would be tautologous (whatever is coming to him is whatever the result of the wish is, so how is the genie to decide what that should be?). Regardless of the outcome, Black Hat is wishing for something already negative with no room for a moral twist, or something that is essentially tautological. This disheartens the genie even more, given the genie's apparent obligation to be inconveniently literal and problematic in interpreting wishes.\nClearly outclassed in his attempt to establish his ability to cause problems, or perhaps out of pity for Black Hat's self-destructive wishes, the genie gets frustrated and backtracks rapidly. He offers just $20 (a token amount of money, possibly out of his own pocket in order to completely avoid using his potentially dangerous magical abilities) to get himself out of the original formulaic deal and permanently away from having to be under Black Hat's influence.\nIn the title text, the wisher (possibly still Black Hat, or possibly just another rather awkward individual) wishes for everything in the world. This is itself a not unknown \"bad wish\" that would be creatively twisted into a bad consequence for the necessary narrative reasons (for example, ownership of everything in the world might come with inconvenient or even impossible responsibilities). The wish continues, however, and explicitly asks that all of this be put into their house. This is impossible for two reasons: First, everything wouldn't fit in their house unless it was made extremely dense, beyond the point of usefulness; second, it causes an infinite recursion, since their house is something in the world, so it would have to be put inside itself. Trying to grant this wish would likely also frustrate the genie, and certainly not allow them their usual scope of a personal (and proportional) educational twist.\nBlack Hat has been seen experimenting with the rules for wishing before, in 1086: Eyelash Wish Log .\n[Black Hat is holding a genie lamp in his hands. A genie has appeared from the end of the lamp.

This time, every major island that is not considered a continent in its own right is relocated into similarly-sized swathes of sea partly enclosed by the outlines of adjacent continents. The caption implies it's Earth's intended \"storage mode\", where everything 'loose' is neatly packed away. A similar comic is found at 1784: Bad Map Projection: Liquid Resize .\nThe comic thus equates the world to a playroom in which the islands are the equivalent of scattered toys left out after playtime, or an office space where 'polite notices' request users to replace materials, equipment, etc. in its intended storage, to leave it presentable for the next users. It indicates that the loose islands can be properly stored away in the nooks and crannies of the larger landmasses, possibly so they can be easily located when the next person comes along to play with or use them. The comic title may also be a pun aligned with the design concept of an island kitchen, or possibly other similar room types, in which a central area of worktop may be designed with space for the seating (when not in use) or legs (when people are sat) even amongst the other utensil\/equipment storage as required.\nThough much of the apparent strange distortions of relocated islands are probably due to the relative changes in length\/area\/angle across differing parts of the planar-stretched map of the globe (depending upon the map projection being used), Randall is clearly also not averse to distorting the landmasses slightly to fit even the 'immobile' continental masses. He mentions in the title text that he likes to make use of the jutting outcrop of Scandinavia (though misspelled as it was in 850: World According to Americans ) by flexing it somewhat like one might do with a spring-clip, thus gripping tightly whatever islands he forces within the gap (in this instance, the British Isles and Svalbard).

In the 30 or so seconds it takes to dry the hands, the user may feel as though the air coming from the hand dryer isn't actually warm, [ citation needed ] hence seeming like they \"take forever to heat up,\" while in reality the water evaporating from the user's wet hands absorbs heat from them, as well as the possibly heated air, as evaporation is an endothermic process. Thus the user does not feel that the air from the dryer is warm, even though it is, and will only start to do so once their hands have been significantly dried. Interestingly, this absorption of heat through evaporation is how human sweat has its cooling effect, which means that even warm ambient air can be made to feel colder by being wafted across a person's dampened skin (which is how a regular fan works).\nRandall has procured a small airplane, accompanied by a banner with a message explaining this phenomenon.

And indeed, it seems to be working - a person on the ground has already been enlightened by Randall.\nIn the title text, the speed of sound is the speed of a sound wave [ citation needed ] in a given medium, usually air. Breaking the sound barrier is often touted as a significant achievement for powered aircraft (this was first safely achieved in the 1940s, and became significantly 'easier' with the development of the jet engine). Here, Randall thinks it would be a good idea to continue to complain that all hand dryers take too long to heat up in order to try and get the Dyson company (a technology company known for making high-tech, fancy and expensive air-moving devices such as vacuum-cleaners, fans and hand dryers) to design a hand dryer whose airflow would exceed the sound barrier. The rationale behind that might be that the temperature of the air the hand dryer emits cannot be increased much without harming the user. Therefore the only way to make the hands feel warm earlier would be increasing the airflow until (if we tease the Dyson company long enough) they hit a physical limit. Hitting this limit would be technically difficult to achieve with such a relatively small device as a typical wall-mounted hand dryer [ citation needed ] . Nor would such a hand dryer really be practically useful, given that air currents faster than the speed of sound could cause injury to the hands of the dryer's users, [ citation needed ] amongst other unintended effects.\nThis comic is not the only one to involve people flying banner planes to inform people on technologically related things, as that was previous done in a (lengthier) 1965: Background Apps .\n[An airplane tows a banner. In the distance, there are three small clouds and three birds]\n[On the banner is written:] It seems like hand dryers take forever to heat up, but that's because the evaporation cools your skin, so the hot air feels cold until the water is gone.\nVoice coming from the bottom of the panel: Ohhh!\n[Caption below the panel:] I spent decades mistakenly annoyed at hand dryer engineers, so now I'm on a mission to save others from the same fate.\n"}

It is almost identical to 2036: Edgelord , only different text, and has the same setting as 2654: Chemtrails , except there it is Ponytail that gets annoyed.\nIn all of these comics, modern slang terms or just commonly used words are used to describe jobs or ideas, and while the slang or word seems accurate if taken literally, it isn't normally used in that context. A graph theory Ph.D. was labeled an \"edgelord\", a reference to mathematical graphs having edges, trails of ant pheromones were labeled as \"chemtrails\", a reference to pheromones being chemicals, and scientific hypotheses were referred to as \"fan theories.\"\nThis time a turbine maintenance engineer is described as doing a lot of fanservice, as in literally servicing fans (with which turbines are often inaccurately conflated). A second order of dissonance is introduced from the difference between fans and turbines, which work oppositely: fans use energy to propel a fluid, while turbines use a flowing fluid to generate energy. Randall has previously touched on wind turbines not being fans, most notably in 1378: Turbine .\nFanservice is a term used to describe decisions made in fictional media, usually TV or film productions, that are intended to make the fans happy. The term is sometimes derogatory as it implies some degree of pandering to the fans over finishing the story, and in such cases can be incredibly distracting. It can just mean inserting obscure details of the work's back-history, to spark gleeful recognition among the more devoted fans, but it most often refers to the inclusion of titillating scenes \u2014 the Ms. Fanservice trope where female characters routinely wear form-fitting outfits is a good example.\nIn the title text, Randall refers to HVAC (a term for the unified H eating, V entilation, and A ir C onditioning systems of a given building) as \"the fandom.\" Normally, \"fandom\" means the group of fans of something, but here refers to a domain that uses lots of fans. Randall tells that he was thrown out of his architectural engineering program because I wouldn't stop referring to HVAC as \"the fandom.\" This is related to the many conferences he says he has been banned from .\n[Cueball is talking to White Hat, who has his hands balled into fists and has small lines above his head to indicate he is yelling his response back at Cueball.] Cueball: So, I hear you do a lot of fanservice.

It is slightly skewed counterclockwise:]\nObituaries The cool, attractive, universally beloved editor of the obituary section has died, hopefully of natural causes after a long life.  They take with them the password to the heretofore unrevealed auto-post system.\nThey are survived by 8 billion heartbroken people.  Memorial services will be held daily in all public spaces from now on.\n","explanation":"An obituary is an article in a newspaper about a person who has recently passed away, celebrating their life. (It is distinct from a death notice, which is a paragraph, often short, usually paid, describing a person who has recently passed away. They usually offer a few words of praise and a list of surviving relatives, as well as a scheduled time for memorial services.)\nApparently, the editor of this newspaper's obituary section has just died. However, instead of somebody writing their obituary after the fact, as is conventionally done, the editor has seemingly taken matters into their own hands and written their own obituary. They (somewhat vainly) describe themselves as cool, attractive, and universally beloved, a dubious claim at best. The following sentence reveals that the editor had pre-arranged the scheduled release of this obituary, after their death, probably entirely automatically . Obituaries are often pre-written for famous people, ahead of the actual need arising, as this (not-so-famous) person has done for themself. Though this is generally to avoid needing to rush the writing of every biography, including carefully ensuring it is accurately written and sufficiently complete, leaving only minor circumstantial updates and details to be inserted and checked as and when events lead up to its actual publication.\nRather than the names of some close family (usually parents, a spouse, and children), the editor is allegedly survived by 8 billion people, or the current population of the entire Earth, who further are all heartbroken by the loss. All public spaces will now be reserved for a memorial service of the editor every single day (or, at least, the editor hopes they will be). Given that the entire population of earth is unlikely to care about one obituaries editor at a newspaper, [ citation needed ] the late editor is most likely exaggerating the effect which their death will have.\nThe title text references a common trope in culture, in which a person who has just died decides to challenge Death, or the Grim Reaper , to a game of skill ( usually chess ). Apparently, it is (possibly prematurely) claimed by the editor that they have challenged death to a series of games of skill (probably most or all variations of the trope, including chess), and defeated Death in all of them. Rather than gaining themselves a \"second chance at life,\" however, as is usually the reward promised by Death for the dead person's victory, the editor's victory over Death has been so absolute that Death itself has been nullified for all of humanity. Hence no more obituaries will ever be required, as every human currently alive (and presumably future ones) will now live forever. Of course, if this did actually occur, then the entire population of earth would not be unlikely to care about the editor, because even if the editor's work at the newspaper wasn't significant to them, the editor's role in preventing their deaths would be.  Randall has referenced this trope in 393: Ultimate Game , as a tribute to Gary Gygax, the inventor of Dungeons and Dragons .\n[Text on the top-left corner of a gray newspaper page.

Hairy: And there are bugs.\n","explanation":"A launch window is a brief period of time in which a spacecraft can be launched from Earth's surface such that the spacecraft can reach its destination with the minimal amount (or an amount lower than a threshold of acceptance) of energy expenditure.\nThis comic takes the concept of a \"launch window\" in a more literal direction, implying that they have an actual physical window that is only open at certain times, and through which the rocket presumably has to be launched. Cueball , representing one of the three technicians we see working in a mission control center, suggests moving the rocket outside in order to avoid issues that arise from dealing with the window. This immediately gets pushback by the other technicians who, in stereotypical behavior of shut-ins, don't want to bother leaving their comfortable computers. Ponytail complains the outside 'is so sunny', which ironically would normally indicate good conditions that would permit a launch. Hairy also objects because it would cause them to have to deal with bugs, presumably not of the technical type which might commonly prevent a launch , but more of the living, biting kind.\nThe title text continues the comic\u2019s theme of taking aerospace terms literally, with a play on the two meanings of scrub . Normally, in the context of a rocket launch, this would mean to cancel the launch, but here it apparently means that some cleaning job is required, possibly of the window in question (though how that would help them to launch the rocket through it is unclear), or possibly to deal with the aftermath of launching through the closed window.\n[Ponytail and Hairy can be seen sitting either side of a technical-looking double-sided console, with Hairy, on the right side, wearing a mike-and-headphones headset.] Ponytail: The launch window will only be open for another 90 minutes.

For her, the contents of this death trap would be happily considered a suitable present or experience gift, and apparently even the dire circumstances don't dampen the experience sufficiently to reduce her interest.\nThe caption also mentions that there is a surprising amount of overlap between what would be \"good presents for biologists\" (like the ornithologist, James Bond ?) and \"things villains want to do to James Bond\".

Randall labels this fact as being \"normal,\" complete with a large green checkmark to verify this. The unit circle is typically used in abstract contexts rather than applications with a specific length unit (such as meters). For example, the trigonometric functions cosine and sine can be define the x and y coordinates of a point on the unit circle without any additional factor.\nThe second fact states that one radian is equal to the length of a circle's radius. This isn't actually the way that the unit is defined. Instead, radians are usually defined as the angle encompassing an arc of a circle equal in length to its radius. This comic's logic is thus somewhat erroneous. However, this fact is still labeled as also being \"normal.\" Also, while Randall again uses the unit circle in the fact's associated diagram, any circle could theoretically be used to show the conventional definition. Under the standard definition of an angle as the ratio of the length of a circular arc to its radius, the radian is a dimensionless unit equal to 1.\nA correct version of the second fact would be that a radian has the same value (1) as the radius of the unit circle.\nThe third fact states that one radian is equal to 57.3\u00b0. This is indeed true (albeit rounded). The circumference of a circle is 2\u03c0 radius-lengths, so the angle of a complete circle is both 2\u03c0 rad and 360\u00b0. Thus 1 rad = 180\/\u03c0\u00b0. This fact is again labeled \"normal.\"\nThe fourth and final fact states that because it was determined in earlier facts that a radian is equal to the radius of the unit circle as well as 57.3\u00b0, then the radius of the unit circle must be equal to 57.3\u00b0. This is usually not how degrees are supposed to work, because they are a measure of angle, not length. Hence, this fact is labeled \"cursed\" by Randall, leading to the comic's title. (However, since the radian is also an angular measure, the second fact could be viewed as equally cursed.)\nThe title text is referring to Phil Plait 's claim about the size of the sky, which was published on his blog: http:\/\/www.badastronomy.com\/bitesize\/bigsky.html . Dimensional analysis utilizes the rationale that both sides of an equation need to have the same unit. Radius typically refers to a length, which has SI units of meters. The surface area has SI units of square meters. The units of Phil Plait's \"angular area\" is as the title text mentions, square degrees . Thus the comic's dimensional analysts (not a profession, but instead the adherents of the mathematical technique) are said to be angered by this argument.\nRandall has alluded to Plait's angular area tip previously in his own blog What If? , in a post that examined the chances of hitting various celestial objects with a laser blast aimed at random from Earth's surface.\n[Title:] Math facts\n[A diagram of a circle is shown with radius labeled as \u201c1\u201d] The unit circle has a radius of one [In green] \u2713 Normal [The diagram now has another (unlabeled and lighter) radius at a 57.3 degree angle.

This would require several solar systems' worth of matter to do, and materials with a tensile strength beyond what is likely physically possible for any known form of matter. The planets of our solar system would not be suitable for this endeavor; alas, Randall apparently cannot comprehend why NASA is rejecting this proposal to \"improve\" the planets.\nThe title text explains what would happen to the asteroid belt if this was done. He is proposing that the asteroids should be turned into ball bearings to go in between the planetary discs. There is enough matter in the asteroid belt to do this, dependent upon the size and distribution of the ball bearings used, and furthermore it implies that the discs would actually have small gaps between them. Unless the discs were made of material with impossibly high tensile strength, the whole structure would soon be torn apart by the relative forces between the inner and outer fringes of each disc trying to both 'orbit' at the rate more suited to a radial distance somewhere between the two, and crushing the bearings placed between adjacent ones. Although less so than with a single structural disc rotating at any single given compromise rotation (or not at all).\n[This comic depicts a situation where the planets of the Solar System are flattened using a rolling pin to create a contiguous ring system around the Sun, with each planet taking up the part within their orbit to the next planet (or the Sun).]\n[The top part shows a normal image of the Solar System with the eight planets orbiting the Sun, and their orbits shown as circles.

When asked to \"pass the salt,\" Cueball, with his extensive knowledge of the Earth's crust and its interactions with the surface, is aware of this pressure phenomenon, and as such is stomping on his chair in order to create downward pressure on the ground beneath. This apparently works exactly as intended, as a salt dome has risen out of the floor and even begun to break through the dinner table. The caption humorously remarks that this is what will happen if you ask any geologist to \"pass the salt,\" which conventionally means to simply hand a salt shaker or dispenser to another diner who cannot reach it. A salt shaker, presumably containing the salt intended to be passed, can be seen on their table. \"The general problem\" of passing salt and other condiments is discussed in comic 974 .\nCueball mentions overburden pressure , a geological term referring to the pressure that outer layers of rock exert on inner layers. This is what usually causes the rising of salt domes; however Cueball's stomping on his chair would not produce sufficient overburden pressure to raise a salt dome. [ citation needed ] Interestingly, this is exactly the kind of Strange powers Beret Guy, who is also present at the table, usually displays (similar power is shown in 1388: Subduction License ).\nThe title text mentions the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , a United States government reserve of oil for use in emergencies. Randall observes the true fact that artificial caves within hollowed-out salt domes create the spaces for storage of this oil; in fact, naturally-occurring petroleum is often found under salt domes . The joke in the title text is Randall's claim that salt domes that are not yet hollow are used to store the US salt reserve. Of course this could be seen as true, but this salt is not put there by humans, but by nature, and is thus not stored there by any government. Further, the use of the term \"salt dome\" in the title text plays on the ambiguity between geological salt domes and the monolithic dome structures commonly used to store reserves of road salt, which also are commonly referred to as \"salt domes\".\nOrdinary salt is available in abundance throughout the U.S. [1] so there is no need for a national strategic salt reserve. [ citation needed ] However, the UK does maintain an Emergency Salt Reserve [2] as part of a Strategic Salt Protocol [3] to ensure highways can be salted during prolonged wintry weather, just as most communities throughout the world regularly using salt on roads stockpile it for such purposes.\n[This comic is drawn on a gray background, with the segment beneath the floor in dark gray.

Megan: What's the lower limit for \"number of bees\"? Black Hat: A normal amount. Air Handler: Bzzzzzz\n","explanation":"In many devices that manage certain atmospheric conditions in a building using one device, an operational range is usually defined, and not one number.  For example, when using a heat pump , if the interior temperature drops below a preset lower limit, then the heating function would be activated.  If the interior temperature rises above another preset upper limit, the cooling function would be activated. This kind of ranged function is common with humidifier\/dehumidifier units as well, to create a comfortable condition not too dry nor damp for comfort.  By specifying upper and lower limits for the operation of the device in question, minor variations of the controlled value will not cause the device to be rapidly turning on and off, even working against itself, improving efficiency and reducing unnecessary wear and tear on the device and the building contents.\nDevices that manage temperature and humidity are often installed in buildings to improve occupant comfort.  Beyond that, the listed qualities become increasingly problematic and even dangerous.\nChanging the pressure of the air could lead to unintended effects like large winds blowing through any cracks in the building.\nThe air handler also attempts to force the parameters of dust, smoke, odors, and number of bees into an \"ideal\" range. However, as opposed to being in a certain range, most people who live indoors prefer that these be minimized. [ citation needed ] It's also worth noting that \"a normal amount\" of bees varies widely depending on the situation. A typical honeybee colony contains 60,000 to 80,000 bees , and a typical swarm (bees looking to establish a new hive) is anywhere from 1,500 to 30,000 . To pollinate an acre of fruiting trees typically requires a minimum of 20,000 bees , or approximately five bees per square meter.\nIt is not particularly usual to directly monitor the number of bees in an air-stream (usually, insect-screens are the main way to filter out any pesky creatures that might find themselves likely to be caught up in that way), and one might imagine that the upper limit should be zero, for use indoors in standard living\/working spaces, but it might be technically feasible to accurately count bees (with or without distinguishing from wasps and other flying insects) and be able to allow some . But, unlike temperature or humidity, it would be rare (outside of a location used for agriculture) to have a non-zero minimum desirable quantity of bees. Even more so to then be directly equipped to upwardly correct the current value. For any minimum value that is not zero, this machine would be equipped to deal with it by, presumably, releasing bees (it seems to have at least one trapped inside it ready to be released, judging by the buzzing sound), or by generating smoke, dust and odors \u2013 something one would typically not miss if lacking.\nAs the title text elaborates, the machine analyses and adjusts the 'freshness' of the air. A smart system in charge of odor-control (by spraying smell-suppressing chemicals and\/or more desirable and dominant scents) could be made less wasteful by only trying to 'freshen' the air when it detects enough necessity. But, of course, this machine also has an opposing limit. And, when the air is considered too fresh, it has a way of adding staleness\/stinkiness to meet expectations with dirty laundry.\n[Black Hat is standing to the right of an \"air handler\", talking to Cueball and Megan on the left side, probably presenting the sales pitch for the air handler in between them.] Black Hat: Our device monitors your home's air and keeps every variable between a lower and upper limit.\n[Zoom in on Black Hat] Black Hat: Temperature, humidity, pressure, dust, smoke, odors, number of bees...\n[Zoom out similar to Frame #1] Megan: Wait.

The thing they're relative to is a sewing machine.\n","explanation":"The terms \"small\" and \"big\" are used to refer to size; the terms \"loud\" and \"quiet\" are used to refer to (audial) volume. While these terms are relative, they are often used even when there is nothing obvious being compared against (e.g. \"A windmill is a big thing\" or \"An ant is a small thing\").\nThis comic humorously suggests that the item defined to be in the middle of all four terms (\"neither small nor big; neither quiet nor loud\") is a sewing machine, as a sewing machine seems (at least in comparison to the other items on the graph) to be neither particularly big nor particularly small; neither particularly quiet nor particularly loud. A standard sewing machine is roughly 60dB in volume and approximately 42\u201d X 21\u201d, although this is for industrial machines, and those in the home (table-top electric models) would be both smaller and quieter. More antique treadle-powered sewing machines might include the treadle-table, as an integral part of its size, but could be even quieter if kept well-maintained.\nAs the reference point, the sewing machine is placed in the center of the chart, while a selection of other example objects are located in the four quadrants around it, based on whether they are considered to be small or big, and loud or quiet. Many of the items might appear to have been placed in the wrong quadrant for their actual attributes; locations may reflect more how Randall generally thinks of these things, as opposed to others' subjective ideas of their real-life relationship to a sewing machine.\nOther references from everyday life that could be placed in the center include the average adult human (the perspective from which people might measure other things), a bread-bin\/box (a popular comparison for size in certain situations , but doesn't fit the bill in terms of loudness), or even something like \"the size of a large\/small\/medium-sized dog\" (which highly depends upon a shared reference of which breeds are commonly encountered, and dogs might be considered too loud to be in the middle of the volume range), all things that are often encountered. A sewing machine may once have been found in many homes, but some of the comic's comedic value may arise from the relative rarity in modern times.\nThe title text is humorously tautological because it compares the standard against those things that are themselves defined against the standard.\n[A chart, with \"Quiet\" to \"Loud\" on the X-axis, and \"Small\" to \"Big\" on the Y-axis.

Meta-analyses are intended to account for possible individual error within each study, summarizing the general results of all of its studies in order to potentially draw a useful conclusion. For a meta-analysis to be possible, there must be some measured variable in common across the included studies.\nHere, the meta-analysis consists of a graph of effect sizes for what is allegedly every single study ever conducted. Accordingly, even page 53,589 of the meta-analysis is only about 1\/4 of the total graph, as the scroll bar on the right is only about 1\/4 of the way down; this makes the total included in the meta-analysis approximately 210,000 pages, or around 2.3 million studies. Below the graph is an estimate of the \"average effect\" across all of these variables, the effect normally being the relationship being analyzed by the studies within a meta-analysis, though here it seems again to be just a conglomerate of all known effects, along with a (likely) 95% confidence interval for the findings of the meta-analysis. It's absurd to analyze all studies this way, as the variables that all of those studies measure are wildly different and it makes no sense whatsoever to average (or otherwise analyze) them together. In addition, 2.3 million scientific studies is much too small a number; a recent estimate is that about 3 million papers are published each year , and while not all of them would have a numerical hypothesis test, many others would have several such tests.\nStatistical studies are produced by generating hypotheses and then testing those hypotheses. A meta-analysis of all studies would therefore include both studies where the original hypothesis turns out to be false, as well as studies where the original hypothesis is confirmed. Hypotheses that fail to be confirmed by studies are often discarded; however, these studies would still be included in this meta-analysis.\nIn the caption, Randall delivers the bad news: that the meta-analysis of \"all of science\" has finally been performed, and as it turns out, the results are not significant. Statistical significance is the degree  to which the results of a sample or study are likely due to a correlation, as opposed to chance or sampling variation alone. Apparently, across the entirety of human science in the study of our universe, the study has found a lack of significance, or of a relationship between all the variables measured by all the studies ever.\nThe joke lies in the absurdity of the claim that \"all of science\" can be analyzed at all. Science is not a singular term that can be subcategorized in such a manner, but is rather hundreds of different fields of study, many of which have little or no overlap. Doing a meta-analysis of geology and philosophy, for example, would be patently ridiculous, so the 53,589 (or 210,000) page study is comical in its very existence, much less conclusion. In addition the comic conflates two meanings of \"significant\": the statistical meaning, and the more everyday meaning of importance or noteworthiness.\nAdditionally to the absurdity, one can see the whole joke as an instance of the Liar paradox : if one considers that the conclusion of the meta-analysis is that \"science\" is statistically unable to provide information on the truth of a statement, then the meta-analysis itself (in it has been made following the general principles of rigor and methods of \"science\") is subject to its conclusion. Hence, the conclusion of the meta-analysis might have nothing to do with the truth, and \"science\" might well be significant after all. But if it is, then the present meta-analysis should be considered significant as well and one should believe its conclusion, etc.\nIn the title text, Randall reports that subgroup analysis is ongoing. The joke here is that since all scientific studies are subsets of the overall meta-analysis, every field of scientific endeavor can be separately assessed by constraining the subgroup to include only studies in that field. Hence the subgroup analysis could be considered to include analyses of every individual area or question that scientists have made subject to statistical studies. Again, analyzing any subgroup would lump together studies that measured very different things and hence would still be meaningless.\nXKCD has previously considered the topic of subgroup analyses around the important issue of jelly beans .  Subgroup analyses may be used as data dredging or p-hacking in order to identify anything that is \"significant\" and thus publishable.\nMeta-analysis Inclusion criteria: All studies\n[A forest plot is shown.

These aircraft do not take off or land with the banner in tow, but instead have a hook and release mechanism to add and drop the banner in flight . The banner could be interpreted as a recruitment ad by an aerial advertising company looking for additional pilots. But the humorous interpretation is that the banner is a distress signal \u2013 the pilot of the aircraft doesn't know how to land, and is hoping that someone will see the banner and give assistance. This makes the banner self-referential, because the presence of the banner (which makes landing difficult) is the very reason for displaying the banner. It is paradoxical, because printing and deploying the banner requires planning, [ citation needed ] and if the pilot had anticipated that they would need assistance to land with a banner, they could have simply chosen not to deploy a banner in the first place.\nThe title text features a caller who dials the \" 555 \" phone number from the banner (see Trivia ) and starts to explain the correct method for landing (detach the banner over a designated empty location then land the plane regularly), but the call is disconnected halfway through. Presumably the number is that of the pilot's cellphone. The call could have disconnected because the aircraft moved out of range of the cell site the phone was connected to and the phone failed to automatically connect to an adjacent cell; or possibly the cell network detected the call on multiple sites due to the phone's altitude and disconnected it from the network; or the plane crashed and the phone was destroyed on impact.\n[A small propeller-driven high-wing airplane tows a banner from left to right.

Ea-n\u0101\u1e63ir was a Sumerian copper merchant, and the writer of the complaint alleged Ea-n\u0101\u1e63ir had scammed him by offering sub-quality copper (echoed by Cueball's counterfeit copper kettle), refused to provide a refund and had fallen short of expectations in other ways. Additional correspondence was discovered, to indicate that this was not their only dissatisfied customer. Ea-n\u0101\u1e63ir was also referenced in 2650: Deepfakes .\nIn recent years, this complaint tablet has become an internet meme, deriving humor from the fact that so many of its themes (business fraud, poor customer service, a hapless consumer trying to get his money back) are still very much applicable today, nearly 4,000 years later. One such meme references a 2021 fraud case in Turkey, in which a trader was charged 36 million USD for a shipment of copper ingots, which turned out to be stones, painted with a veneer to make them look like copper .

Then \"maser\", which is a type of laser and changes only one word in the acronym, he also explains correctly. Although in both cases he includes the definite article into the expanded phrase (\"by the\", instead of just the more usual \"by\"), to the same ultimate meaning and with short words that are traditionally not so often used in the initialisms (like \"of\" is not, here, also) and thus allows them to be more pronouncable acronyms that have become words in their own right rather than more awkward initialisms.\nHe then makes the following three entries, and the further actual word from the title text, follow precisely the same pattern by simply taking the full phrase for \"laser\"\/\"maser\" and changing the first word, as appropriate, and the initial letter of any other words that need to change to fit. The replacement first word is correct for these acronyms, but the other words formed from changing the first letter are nonsense.\nLaser and maser are true-to-life acronyms. The remaining three acronyms' true expansions are as given in the table. The false definitions suppose that all of the acronyms simply follow the same model as the first two correct ones, and swap out the necessary letters to fit in a square-peg-round-hole manner. Note that the latter three in the table each include the second letter from their first word, for their partly- syllabic abbreviation as derived from their true phrase of origin.\nThe title text extends this to the five-letter word \"lever\". This is an ordinary word, not a commonly used acronym. Levers have been used since time immemorial (even animals have been known to use them) , and predates high-tech uses of radiation by millennia (it's one of the simple machines that Archimedes studied in Ancient Greece). Etymonline traces the origin of the word to the year 1300, from the French \"levier\", which shares the same definition.\nEasily-Confused Acronyms Cheat Sheet\n\nLaser\nLight Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation\nMaser\nMicrowave Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation\nSonar\nSound Omplification by the Nimulated Emission of Radiation\nRadar\nRadio Amplification by the Dimulated Amission of Radiation\nLidar\nLight Implification by the Dimulated Amission of Radiation\nLEVER is an uncommonly used acronym for Light Electric Vehicle Education and Research."}

He may be under the impression that dinosaurs looked like their skeletons and therefore, were \"rocks\" that could walk, or perhaps just that their skeletons were actually made of rock, making those 'rocks' more cool than our modern inanimate ones.\nThe title text suggests that turtles are a form of animate rock. This could be interpreted in two ways. In the first interpretation, you could say that their hard shells make them seem like rocks that are able to move on their own. This gives the latest approximation to modern \"rocks\" that do more or look cooler than just plain old rocks. In the second interpretation, the text could be generalizing the idea of bone-based armor as \"rocks\" to other animals. This would include other armored animals like armadillos and pangolins. Extending it beyond bone-based to any hard outer construction could encompass many other life forms - for example, shellfish and corals.\n[Cueball and Megan and standing beside each other in what is presumably a museum, and are viewing a stegosaurus skeleton.

However, because a minuscule portion of each planet is visible on the page at that scale, it becomes comically useless at distinguishing the size or relative size of each planet, and each planet is just a differently textured straight line. To understand the diagram, imagine you are sitting a tremendous distance away from the solar system, and you have a camera with an extremely supremely highly zooming telephoto lens. Then all eight planets happen to line up. You manage to snap this incredible image of a teeny tiny spot of the sky, which simultaneously manages to include the very edges of all the planets as well as some of the space behind them all. Space is the black polygon in the center. The reason why each planet is so smooth is because it's such a small area: you're only seeing a couple of square inches of the surface of each of the planets.\nThe title text remarks that it is hard to find a display that supports a version of the image without cropping. This is because a true 1:1 scale image showing each of the planets would be ridiculously large [1] , larger than any monitor or display currently available on Earth (since it would be much larger than Earth, in fact it would would have to be larger than Jupiter, to depict 1:1).\n[A frame with a central area of black 'space', bounded at various intersecting angles by eight 'straight lines' representing planetary surfaces, originating from various out-of-frame angles of 'down' and the white of some bodies obscuring some part of the others.] [There are labels indicating which line represents each planet.] [The four gas-giants' lines are simply drawn, near straight and featureless.] [The lines for the rocky inner-planets have variations to them, stereotypical of some part of their surface.] [The \"Earth\" line ('down' being out the top of the frame) has a profile indicating various small-scale vegetation and also features the white sillouette of an ant that may be of a realistic size for your display.] [Caption below the panel:] The solar system's planets at 1:1 scale\n"}
